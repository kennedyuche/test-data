Item 1,OVERVIEW,"RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance. We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, managed funds and underwriting platforms around the world. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., RREAG, Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and our Lloyd’s syndicate, Syndicate 1458. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures, managed funds and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through Syndicate 1458 and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Syndicate 1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses, and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. We also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures, including DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Upsilon RFO and Vermeer. In addition, through Medici, we invest in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk.
Our mission is to match desirable, well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter. We believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term, and to protect communities and enable prosperity. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles, and keeping our promises. Our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We believe this metric is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance, and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time. The principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income, investment income, and fee income generated by our third-party capital management business.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance, and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we have cultivated strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of several initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products, and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business.
Our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance, although as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business, we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements. We also pursue a number of other opportunities, such as creating and managing our joint ventures and managed funds, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk, and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk
other than catastrophe reinsurance. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures or managed funds, or the acquisition of, or the investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies.
We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds. The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate.
A meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. Our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers that are affected by these events. We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover, which primarily impact our Property segment, in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. Our Casualty and Specialty business, which represents approximately half of our gross premiums written annually, is an efficient use of capital that is generally less correlated with our Property business. It allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations. We have created, and manage, multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.","RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance.

Item 1,CORPORATE STRATEGY,"Our mission is to match desirable, well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter. We believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term, and to protect communities and enable prosperity. Our strategy for achieving these objectives, which is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture, is to operate an integrated system of what we believe are our three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and superior capital management. We believe all three competitive advantages are required to achieve our objectives, and we aim to seamlessly coordinate the delivery of these competitive advantages for the benefit of our shareholders, ceding insurers, brokers, investors in our joint ventures and managed funds, and other stakeholders.
Superior Customer Relationships. We aim to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. We believe our modeling and technical expertise, our risk management products, and our track record of keeping our promises have made us a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We seek to offer stable, predictable and consistent risk-based pricing and a prompt turnaround on claims.
Superior Risk Selection. We aim to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive risk-adjusted return on utilized capital. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as REMS©. We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company.
Superior Capital Management. We aim to write as much attractively priced business as is accessible to us and then manage our capital accordingly. We generally look to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline
and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture and managed fund investors. In using joint ventures and managed funds, we aim to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base, develop fee income, generate profit commissions, diversify our portfolio, and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital providers. We also routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture and managed fund opportunities and strategic investments.
We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team, our integrated and flexible underwriting and operating platform, our significant financial strength, our strong relationships with brokers and customers, our commitment to superior service and our proprietary modeling technology. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited.","Our strategy for achieving these objectives, which is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture, is to operate an integrated system of what we believe are our three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and superior capital management.

Item 1,Strategic Investments,"We also pursue strategic investments where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants. These investments may be directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance, and at times may also be directed at non-insurance risks, such as Insurtech opportunities. We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market. For example, we have a minority shareholding in Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd, a long-term consolidator in the non-life insurance/reinsurance run-off sector, which is accounted for at fair value and is included in other investments. Other examples of strategic investments include our investments in the Tower Hill Companies, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also have investments in Essent Group Ltd. and Trupanion Inc., which are accounted for at fair value and are included in equity investments trading.
The carrying value of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet, individually or in the aggregate, may differ significantly from the realized value we may ultimately attain. For example, we believe that our investments in the Tower Hill Companies, which are recorded under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, would attract a significantly higher valuation than what is currently recognized in our consolidated financial statements. However, under GAAP, we are prohibited from recording these investments at fair value. In addition, there is no liquid market for these investments.","We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market.

Item 1,NEW BUSINESS,"From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures and managed funds, or the acquisition of, or investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies. This potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted, additional classes of risk-exposed business, both directly for our own account and through new joint venture opportunities. We also regularly evaluate potential strategic opportunities we believe might utilize our skills, capabilities, proprietary technology and relationships to support possible expansion into further risk-related coverages, services and products. Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage.
We regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business, enhance or focus our strategies, expand our distribution or capabilities, or provide other benefits. In evaluating potential new ventures or investments, we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity, the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage, and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core operations. We believe that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities and track record of our Capital Partners and Strategic Investments teams.","Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage.

We believe that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities and track record of our Capital Partners and Strategic Investments teams."
Item 1,COMPETITION,"The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries, divisions and/or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies, reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies, domestic and international underwriting operations, such as managing general agents, as well as a range of other entities offering risk transfer protection on a collateralized or other non-traditional basis. As our business and the (re)insurance industry continue to evolve, we expect our competitors to evolve as well, and we may face competition from other non-traditional participants, such as technology or Insurtech companies, among others.
We believe that our principal competitors include traditional insurance and reinsurance companies such as Allied World Assurance Company, AG, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Argo Group, Ark Insurance Holdings Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXA XL, Axis Capital Holdings Limited, Chubb Limited, Conduit Holdings Limited, Convex Re Limited, Core Specialty Insurance Holdings, Inc., Everest Re Group, Ltd., Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., James River Insurance Company, LGT Capital Partners Ltd., Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., PartnerRe Ltd., SiriusPoint Reinsurance Ltd., Sompo International, Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (a part of Alleghany Corporation), Validus Reinsurance Ltd. (a part of American International Group Inc.) and Watford Re Ltd. (a part of Arch Capital Group Ltd.).
Our principal competitors also include third-party capital managers such as Aeolus Re Ltd., AlphaCat Managers (a part of American International Group Inc.), Credit Suisse Insurance Linked Strategies, Fermat Capital Management, LLC, Elementum Advisors, LLC, Hudson Structured Capital Management, Leadenhall Capital Partners, LGT Capital Partners Ltd., Nephila Capital Ltd. (a part of Markel Corporation), Pillar Capital Management Limited and Securis Investment Partners LLC.
We also compete with certain Lloyd’s syndicates active in the London market, such as those managed by Beazley PLC, Hiscox Ltd., and Lancashire Holdings, as well as with several other industry participants, such as American International Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the D. E. Shaw Group, Hannover Re AG, Ironshore Inc., Munich Reinsurance Company and Swiss Re Ltd.
Hedge funds, pension funds and endowments, investment banks, insurance exchanges and other capital market participants may also be active in the reinsurance market and the market for related risk, either through the formation of reinsurance companies (such as Aeolus Re Ltd., Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., and SiriusPoint Reinsurance Ltd.) or through the use of financial products, such as catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities.
The tax policies of the countries where our customers operate, as well as government sponsored or backed insurance companies and catastrophe funds may also affect demand for reinsurance, sometimes significantly. Moreover, government-backed entities may represent competition for the coverages we provide, either directly or by competing for the business of our customers, thereby reducing the potential amount of third-party private protection our clients may need or desire.","The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.

Item 1,Underwriting Risk Management,"Our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders’ equity, subject to prudent risk constraints, and to generate long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We assess each new (re)insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk.
We have developed a proprietary pricing and exposure management system, REMS©, which has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental (re)insurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of (re)insurance contracts. We believe that REMS© is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and culture. In conjunction with pricing models that we run outside of REMS©, the REMS© framework encompasses and facilitates risk capture, analysis, correlation, portfolio aggregation and capital allocation within a single system for all of our natural and non-natural hazards (re)insurance contracts. We continue to invest in and improve REMS©, incorporating our underwriting and modeling experience and adding proprietary software and industry data. We continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural and non-natural hazard models in REMS©. Through organic and inorganic growth over the last ten years, we have developed our casualty and specialty modeling tools and capabilities in line with our business needs. We believe that the expertise and tools added throughout this period are state of the art and have been fully embedded in our underwriting processes.
We generally utilize a multiple model/method approach when evaluating a proposed transaction, combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques. We combine the analyses generated by REMS© with other information and other model inputs available to us, including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program, to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of utilized capital which the program presents. The underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and REMS© framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available models. We use commercially available models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and REMS© results.
Before we bind a (re)insurance risk, exposure data, historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers. Using a combination of proprietary software, underwriting experience, actuarial techniques and engineering expertise, the exposure data is reviewed and augmented, as we deem appropriate. We use this data as primary inputs into the REMS© modeling system as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk being evaluated. We believe that the REMS© modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis, assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk to be assumed. In part, through the process described above and the utilization of REMS©, we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks. A key advantage of our REMS© framework is our ability to include additional perils, risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in commercially available natural hazards risk models. For instance, we believe that we are able to incorporate the risk of an increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes due to climate change in our models more comprehensively than commercially available models.
We periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in REMS© and our other tools, driven either by new hazard science and understanding or by experience of loss events. For example, the movement in cedant loss estimates seen across the market in the months following Hurricane Irma prompted us to perform, in conjunction with several partner companies, a detailed review of the nature of the claims made as a result of that and subsequent events. We have reviewed the prevalence of “assignment of benefits” activity in underlying claims, as well as the impact of loss adjusting expenses and the costs associated with any litigation (often called social inflation), and this process has informed a change in our view of reinsurance risk based on observed behavioral norms. We continually monitor frequency and severity trends for our casualty lines of business, in particular emerging trends toward higher levels of social inflation. Where appropriate, we are able to shift our business mix away from classes and industry sectors that are particularly sensitive to higher social inflation trends. More generally our team of scientists at RenaissanceRe Risk Sciences Inc. have been tracking the impact of climate change and expanding urban development on both tornado/hail and wildfire risk over the last several years. The recent history of California wildfire events, and particularly the extreme outbreaks during 2017 and 2018, are being used to validate, and where necessary inform, our representation of this risk.
In order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non-natural hazard reinsurance (i.e., our casualty and specialty lines of business), we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio. In lines with catastrophe risk, such as excess workers’ compensation and terrorism, we seek to directly leverage our skill in modeling property reinsurance risks, and aim to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these casualty and specialty lines and our property reinsurance portfolio. For other classes of business, in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure, and therefore less correlation with our property reinsurance coverages, we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources, including recent historical experience, and the application of judgment as appropriate. The nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis we use for our property reinsurance coverages, reflecting both the nature of available exposure information, and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure. We produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover, which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio.
In addition, we also produce, utilize, and report on models which measure our utilization of capital in light of regulatory capital considerations and constraints. Our position in respect of these regulatory capital models is reviewed by our risk management professional staff and periodically reported to and reviewed by senior underwriting personnel and executive management with responsibility for our regulated operating entities.","In conjunction with pricing models that we run outside of REMS©, the REMS© framework encompasses and facilitates risk capture, analysis, correlation, portfolio aggregation and capital allocation within a single system for all of our natural and non-natural hazards (re)insurance contracts.

Item 1,Enterprise Risk Management,"We believe that high-quality and effective ERM is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the organization and consider ERM to be a key process which is the responsibility of every individual within the Company. We have developed and utilize tools and processes we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. We believe that our ERM processes and practices help us to identify potential events that may affect us, quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed, and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives. We also believe that effective ERM assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments, underwriting decisions, or other operating or business activities, although we do not believe this risk can be eliminated. In particular, we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital and liquidity positions, on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries, and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support the risks we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries.
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing enterprise-wide risk management and is actively involved in the monitoring of risks that could affect us. The members of the Board have regular, direct ccess to the senior executives and other officers responsible for identifying and monitoring our risks and coordinating our ERM, including our Group Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Group General Counsel, each of whom reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other senior personnel such as our Chief Investment Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller and Head of Internal Audit. The Board also receives regular reports from the Controls and Compliance Committee described below.
Our ERM framework operates via a three lines of defense model. The first line of defense consists of individual functions that deliberately assume risks on our behalf and own and manage risk within the Company on a day-to-day and business operational basis. The second line of defense is responsible for risk oversight and also supports the first line to understand and manage risk. A dedicated risk team led by the Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible for this second line and reports to the Board of Director’s Investment and Risk Management Committee and the Chief Executive Officer. The third line of defense, our Internal Audit team, reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and provides independent, objective assurance as to the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems and also coordinates risk-based audits and compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business.
The principal risk areas that make up our ERM framework are assumed risk (including reserve risk), business environment risk and operational risk:
•Assumed Risk. We define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against our capital base, including underwriting risks and other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and market risk as they relate to investments, ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk, each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques. Of these, we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us. In order to understand, monitor, quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk, we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities and the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile. We use the tools and methods described above in “Underwriting” to seek to achieve these objectives. Embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of our aggregate, consolidated risk profile. In part through the utilization of REMS© and our other systems and procedures, we analyze our in-force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis. We believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures and to rigorously analyze and evaluate individual proposed transactions in the context of our in-force portfolio. This aggregation process captures line of business, segment and corporate risk profiles, calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance. Generally, additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk, credit risk, capital adequacy and liquidity. This information is used in day-to-day decision making for underwriting, investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and consolidated financial position perspective. We also regularly assess, monitor and review our regulatory risk capital and related constraints.
•Reserve Risk. Reserve risk is a subcomponent of assumed risk. We define reserve risk as the risks related to our reserve for net claims and claim expenses, including the amount, both absolute and relative, of our outstanding reserve for net claims and claim expenses, and the impact of economic, social, legal and regulatory matters. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty and has the potential to develop adversely in future periods. While reserve risk may increase in both absolute terms and relative to its overall consideration in our ERM framework, we employ robust resources, procedures and technology to identify, understand, quantify and manage this risk. Our reserving methodologies and sensitivities for each respective line of business described in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves.”
•Business Environment Risk. We define business environment risk as the risk of changes in the business, political or regulatory environment that could negatively impact our short term or long-term financial results or the markets in which we operate. This risk area also typically includes emerging risks. These risks are predominately extrinsic to us and our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited, so we focus our efforts on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of, and ensure compliance with, any new requirements applicable to us.
Operational Risk. We are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational, regulatory, and other matters. We define operational risk to include the risk we fail to create, manage, control or mitigate the people, processes, structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk, and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us. In light of the rapid evolution of our markets, business environment, and business initiatives, we seek to continually invest in the tools, processes and procedures we use to mitigate our exposure to operational risk on a cost-effective basis. As with assumed risk and business environment risk, operational risk presents intrinsic uncertainties, and we may fail to appropriately identify or mitigate applicable operational risk.
Controls and Compliance Committee. The Controls and Compliance Committee is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit, staff compliance and controls professionals and representatives from our other business units. The purpose of the Controls and Compliance Committee is to establish, assess the effectiveness of, and enforce policies, procedures and practices relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, regulatory, legal, compliance and related matters, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Code of Ethics, and other relevant standards. In addition, the Controls and Compliance Committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially raise complex and/or significant tax, legal, accounting, regulatory, financial reporting, reputational or compliance issues.
We address other areas of operational risk through our business continuity and incident response program, human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent, our strict tax protocols and our legal and regulatory policies and procedures.","We have developed and utilize tools and processes we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. The second line of defense is responsible for risk oversight and also supports the first line to understand and manage risk. A dedicated risk team led by the Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible for this second line and reports to the Board of Director’s Investment and Risk Management Committee and the Chief Executive Officer.

We define reserve risk as the risks related to our reserve for net claims and claim expenses, including the amount, both absolute and relative, of our outstanding reserve for net claims and claim expenses, and the impact of economic, social, legal and regulatory matters. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty and has the potential to develop adversely in future periods. Our reserving methodologies and sensitivities for each respective line of business described in “Part II. Item 7. This risk area also typically includes emerging risks. These risks are predominately extrinsic to us and our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited, so we focus our efforts on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of, and ensure compliance with, any new requirements applicable to us. We define operational risk to include the risk we fail to create, manage, control or mitigate the people, processes, structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk, and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us. As with assumed risk and business environment risk, operational risk presents intrinsic uncertainties, and we may fail to appropriately identify or mitigate applicable operational risk. Controls and Compliance Committee. The Controls and Compliance Committee is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit, staff compliance and controls professionals and representatives from our other business units. In addition, the Controls and Compliance Committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially raise complex and/or significant tax, legal, accounting, regulatory, financial reporting, reputational or compliance issues."
Item 1,Environmental and Climate Change Matters,"Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe, and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the severity and frequency of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. While it is difficult to distinguish between permanent climate change and transient climate variability, an ever expanding body of research suggests that these trends are in fact man-made, and, if correct, we believe that this trend will not revert to the mean but continue to worsen. We believe that this increase in severe weather, coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors that will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. Accordingly, we expect an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of claims, especially from properties located in coastal areas.
The consideration of the impacts of climate change is integral to our ERM process. We have taken measures to mitigate losses related to climate change through our underwriting process and by continuously monitoring and adjusting our risk management models to reflect the higher level of risk that we think will persist. We have been progressively integrating the consideration of the financial risk of climate change into our governance frameworks, risk management processes, and business strategies over the past several years, and many of our regulators are increasingly focused on these and other climate change disclosures.
Our Board of Directors and its committees are actively engaged in the oversight of environmental, social and governance initiatives and receive regular updates from management on progress and developments, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors receive regular reports.
As discussed further below under “—Investments,” we structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet our claims obligations, to be well diversified across market sectors and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. To further the sustainability of our investment portfolio, we consider certain environmental, social and governance factors within our investment strategy.
In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, there has been a proliferation of governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to climate change and greenhouse gases, which will also affect our business.","Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes.

Item 1,RATINGS,"Financial strength ratings are an important factor in evaluating and establishing the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies. We have received high claims-paying and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch. These ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations, and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures and ratings may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them. Additionally, rating organizations may make changes in their capital models and rating methodologies, which could have a material impact on our business.
In addition, S&P and A.M. Best assess companies’ ERM practices, which is an opinion on the many critical dimensions of risk that determine overall creditworthiness. RenaissanceRe has been assigned an ERM score of “Very Strong” from each of these agencies, which is the highest ERM score assigned.
See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ratings” for the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment, and details of recent ratings actions.","Financial strength ratings are an important factor in evaluating and establishing the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies.

Item 1,RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES,"We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. We establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies, but which have not yet been paid, “case reserves,” adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us, or incurred but not enough reported to us, which are collectively referred to as “IBNR,” and, if deemed necessary, adding costs for additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts which we believe may not be adequately estimated by the client as of that date, or adequately covered in the application of IBNR. Our reserving committee, which includes members of our senior management, reviews, discusses, and assesses the reasonableness and adequacy of the reserving estimates included in our audited financial statements. Because of the nature of the coverages that we provide, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our policy liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps significantly, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.
Our reserving techniques, assumptions and processes differ among our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. Refer to “Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year development of the reserve for claims and claim expenses, analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” for more information on our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves, and sensitivity analysis for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments.","Claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell.

In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7."
Item 1,INVESTMENTS,"We structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet our claims obligations, to be well diversified across market sectors, and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. The majority of our investments are highly-rated fixed income securities. We also hold a significant amount of short-term investments which have a maturity of one year or less when purchased. In addition, we hold other investments, including direct private equity investments, catastrophe bonds, fund investments and term loans, which offer the potential for higher returns but with relatively higher levels of risk. Our investment portfolio takes into account the duration of our liabilities and the level of strategic asset risk we wish to assume over the medium- to long-term. We may from time to time re-evaluate our investment guidelines and explore investment allocations to other asset classes that either increase or decrease our overall asset risk. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities.
For additional information regarding our investment portfolio, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investments” and “Note 5.

Item 1,MARKETING,"We believe that our modeling and technical expertise, the risk management products we provide to our customers, and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We market our products primarily through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and partners. We believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and, therefore, we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers. We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers, we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds. We target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business.
We believe that primary insurers’ and brokers’ willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing, but also on the financial security of the reinsurer, its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims, the quality of a reinsurer’s service, the reinsurer’s willingness and ability to design customized programs, its long-term stability and its commitment to provide stable reinsurance capacity across market cycles. We believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions, for fast payments on valid claims and for providing creative solutions to our customers’ needs.
Our portfolio of business continues to be characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business, although no current relationship exceeds 10% of our gross premiums written.
Our brokers assess client needs and also perform data collection, contract preparation and other administrative tasks, enabling us to market our products cost effectively. Our distribution is reliant on a small number of broker relationships, which has continued to decrease in recent years as a result of consolidation in the broker sector. We expect this concentration to continue. In 2021, three brokerage firms accounted for 78.0% of our gross premiums written.","We believe that our modeling and technical expertise, the risk management products we provide to our customers, and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide.

Item 1,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY,"Our business and support functions utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers. We have an integrated team of professionals who manage and support our communication platforms, transaction-management systems, and analytics and reporting capabilities, including the development of proprietary solutions like REMS©. We use both cloud services and off-site, secure data centers in North America and Europe for our core applications.
Information security and privacy are important concerns, with an escalating cyber-threat environment and evolving regulatory requirements driving continued investment in this area. Our information security program is designed to meet or exceed industry best practices. We are subject to a number of cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations, such as the BMA’s Insurance Sector Operational Cyber Risk Management Code of Conduct, the NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation. New York’s cybersecurity regulation requires regulated entities, including Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., a New York licensed insurer, and RREAG, US Branch, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect each of their information technology systems as well as their customers’ data. Our program is designed to comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulatory requirements and we continue to evaluate and assess our compliance in the changing regulatory environment.
We have in place, and seek to continuously improve, a comprehensive system of security controls, managed by a dedicated staff. Periodically, we engage the services of reputable third parties to perform security penetration testing, and update our security controls based on any findings. In addition, we are subject to independent assessment and review by regulators, as well as an annual audit of our security controls by our independent internal audit team. We also provide regular security risk education awareness and training sessions for all staff. Despite these efforts, computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct, and other internal or external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions.
We have implemented incident response and business continuity plans for our operations, which are regularly tested with respect to our business-critical infrastructure and systems. We employ data backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are regularly backed up, and can be restored promptly if, and as, needed. In addition, we generally store backup information at off-site locations, in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster. Our recovery plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers and cloud infrastructure. We believe we will be able to utilize these plans to efficiently recover key system functionality in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to various scenarios, such as natural disasters.","We have an integrated team of professionals who manage and support our communication platforms, transaction-management systems, and analytics and reporting capabilities, including the development of proprietary solutions like REMS©.

Item 1,U.S. Regulation,"Admitted Company Regulation. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is a Maryland-domiciled insurer licensed in 26 states and the District of Columbia and accredited as a reinsurer in an additional 24 states. As a U.S. licensed and authorized insurer, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is subject to considerable regulation and supervision by state insurance regulators. State insurance departments regulate insurer solvency, authorized investments, loss and loss adjustment expense and unearned premium reserves, and deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders. They also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of authorized insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and other matters. The MIA, as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s domestic regulator, is the primary financial regulator of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
Holding Company Regulation. We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Maryland, which require Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to file certain reports concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations with the MIA. As the ultimate controlling person in the insurance holding company system, RenaissanceRe must also file an annual enterprise risk report identifying the material risks within the holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
Generally, all affiliate transactions involving Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. must be fair and, if material or of specified types, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the MIA.
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions. Further, Maryland law places limitations on the amounts of dividends or distributions payable by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Payment of ordinary dividends by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. requires notice to the MIA. Declaration of an extraordinary dividend, which must be paid out of earned surplus, generally requires thirty days’ prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval of the MIA. An extraordinary dividend includes any dividend whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (1) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) the insurer’s net investment income, excluding realized capital gains (as determined under statutory accounting principles), for the twelve month period ending December 31 of the preceding year and pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities, plus any amounts of net investment income (subject to the foregoing exclusions), in the three calendar years prior to the preceding year which have not been distributed.
Acquisition of Control. Any person seeking to acquire control of a Maryland-domestic insurer or of an entity that directly or indirectly controls a Maryland-domestic insurer, including its holding company, must file a statement with the MIA at least 60 days before the proposed acquisition of control. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company, its holding company or any other entity directly or indirectly controlling the insurance company is presumed to have acquired control, unless the presumption is rebutted. Therefore, any investor who intends to acquire 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s outstanding voting securities may need to comply with these laws and would be required to file statements and reports with the MIA before such acquisition.
ORSA. The Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency and Assessment Act requires Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to: (i) maintain a risk management framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting its material and relevant risks; (ii) complete an ORSA at least once each year and at any time there is a significant change to the risk profile of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. or its holding company system; and (iii) submit an ORSA summary report to the MIA at least once each year. The obligation to maintain a risk management framework may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group maintains a risk management framework that applies to the operations of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. and the ORSA obligation may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group completes an ORSA in accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency and Assessment Act.
Capital Requirements. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is required to meet certain minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements under Maryland law. At December 31, 2021, we believe that Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus.
Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is also subject to risk-based capital requirements under Maryland law, and must file an annual report of its risk-based capital levels. If the report shows Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s statutory capital and surplus or total adjusted capital is below certain levels, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. may be required to take certain corrective action or the MIA may be permitted or required to take certain regulatory action. As of December 31, 2021, we believe Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s total adjusted capital exceeded the company action level and regulatory action level thresholds.
RREAG, US Branch. RREAG, US Branch is a United States branch of RREAG whose port of entry is New York. Following receipt of applicable regulatory approvals from the New York and Maryland state insurance regulators, the U.S. casualty portfolio of RREAG, US Branch was transferred to Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. through a loss portfolio transfer retrocession agreement effective as of October 1, 2019. The remaining property and specialty business portfolio of RREAG, US Branch will be runoff until all liabilities are extinguished through novation, commutation or expiration, subject to applicable ceding company consent. We expect that the run-off of RREAG, US Branch will not be complete for several years.
RREAG, US Branch is licensed in New York and Kansas and it is an accredited reinsurer in 48 states, and the District of Columbia. The NYDFS is RREAG, US Branch’s domestic insurance regulator in the U.S. As a New York regulated insurer, RREAG, US Branch is subject to New York’s holding company laws as well as laws and regulations pertaining to solvency, authorized investments, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, cybersecurity, corporate governance and the financial risks related to climate change. The NYDFS may conduct periodic examinations of RREAG, US Branch’s affairs and it requires the filing of annual and other reports relating to RREAG, US Branch’s financial condition.
RREAG, US Branch is required to meet certain trusteed surplus requirements under New York law. At December 31, 2021, we believe that RREAG, US Branch’s trusteed surplus exceeded the minimum required statutory level.
RREAG, US Branch must file an annual report of its risk-based capital levels with the NYDFS. If the report shows RREAG, US Branch’s total adjusted capital is below certain levels, RREAG, US Branch may be required to take certain corrective action or the NYDFS may be permitted or required to take certain regulatory action. As of December 31, 2021, we believe RREAG, US Branch’s total adjusted capital exceeded the company action level and regulatory action level thresholds. RREAG, US Branch does not pay ordinary dividends and would need approval from the NYDFS for any return of capital to RREAG.
Reinsurance Regulation. The insurance laws of each U.S. state regulate the sale of reinsurance to licensed ceding insurers by non-admitted alien reinsurers acting from locations outside the state. With some exceptions, the sale of insurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited. Our Bermuda-domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures (principally Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., Upsilon RFO and Vermeer) are all admitted to transact insurance business in Bermuda and do not maintain an office or solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any other jurisdiction where the conduct of such activities would require that any company be so admitted.
RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Insurance as a reinsurance intermediary broker and is required to maintain its reinsurance intermediary broker license in force in order to conduct its reinsurance operations in Connecticut.
Although reinsurance contract terms and rates are generally not subject to regulation by state insurance authorities, a primary U.S. insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit on its statutory financial statements for the reinsurance ceded. State insurance regulators permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted, non-U.S. (alien) reinsurers if the reinsurance contract contains certain minimum provisions and if the reinsurance obligations of the non-U.S. reinsurer are appropriately collateralized. Qualifying collateral may be established by an alien reinsurer exclusively for a single U.S. ceding company. Alternatively, an alien reinsurer that is accredited by a state may establish a multi-beneficiary trust with qualifying assets equal to its reinsurance obligations to all of its U.S. ceding insurers, plus trusteed surplus. Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci and RREAG have all established multi-beneficiary trusts with a qualifying financial institution in New York for the benefit of their respective U.S. cedants.
States also permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted alien reinsurers that post collateral in amounts less than one hundred percent of their reinsurance obligations if the reinsurer (i) has been designated as a “certified reinsurer” and (ii) is domiciled in a country recognized by the state and the NAIC as a “qualified” jurisdiction. A certified reinsurer is a non-U.S. reinsurer that, based on a secure rating assigned by a U.S. state insurance regulator upon an assessment of the reinsurer’s financial condition, financial strength ratings and other factors, may post a reduced collateral amount. Bermuda, the U.K. and Switzerland are listed as qualified jurisdictions by the NAIC, and each of Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci and RREAG has been approved as a “certified reinsurer” eligible for collateral reduction in various states.
States also permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted alien reinsurers that post zero collateral if the reinsurer (i) has been designated as a “reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer” and (ii) is domiciled in a country recognized by the state and the NAIC as a “qualified” jurisdiction. Bermuda, the U.K. and Switzerland are listed as qualified jurisdictions by the NAIC, and each of Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci and RREAG has been approved as a “reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer” eligible for zero collateral in various states.
NAIC Ratios. The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed property and casualty insurance companies. The NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System calculates these ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of such ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall outside of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are themselves immaterial.
Federal Oversight and Other Government Intervention. Although generally the insurance industry is not directly regulated by the federal government, federal legislation and initiatives can affect the industry and our business.The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office, which does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, but has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance, or “covered agreements.” The U.S. and EU entered into a bilateral agreement regarding the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance in 2017. Each party has been working to complete its internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) in order to satisfy the U.S.-EU covered agreement’s substantive and timing requirements. Following the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU, the U.S. and the U.K. also entered into a bilateral agreement in 2018, which largely reflects the provisions of the U.S.-EU covered agreement and incorporates the same timeframes for implementation. The U.S.-EU and U.S.-U.K. covered agreements require U.S. state insurance regulators to work towards eliminating statutory collateral requirements for qualifying EU and U.K. reinsurers. These standards include, among others, minimum capital and solvency or capital ratios, submission to U.S. jurisdictions by the non-U.S. reinsurers and prompt payment of reinsured claims. Under the terms of the covered agreements, as of September 1, 2022, state credit for reinsurance laws that result in non-U.S. reinsurers subject to the covered agreements being treated less favorably than U.S. reinsurers may be pre-empted by the applicable covered agreement.","State insurance departments regulate insurer solvency, authorized investments, loss and loss adjustment expense and unearned premium reserves, and deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders. The MIA, as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s domestic regulator, is the primary financial regulator of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
Holding Company Regulation. As the ultimate controlling person in the insurance holding company system, RenaissanceRe must also file an annual enterprise risk report identifying the material risks within the holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
Generally, all affiliate transactions involving Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. must be fair and, if material or of specified types, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the MIA. Any person seeking to acquire control of a Maryland-domestic insurer or of an entity that directly or indirectly controls a Maryland-domestic insurer, including its holding company, must file a statement with the MIA at least 60 days before the proposed acquisition of control.

The obligation to maintain a risk management framework may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group maintains a risk management framework that applies to the operations of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. and the ORSA obligation may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group completes an ORSA in accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency and Assessment Act. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is also subject to risk-based capital requirements under Maryland law, and must file an annual report of its risk-based capital levels. If the report shows Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s statutory capital and surplus or total adjusted capital is below certain levels, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. may be required to take certain corrective action or the MIA may be permitted or required to take certain regulatory action.

Bermuda, the U.K. and Switzerland are listed as qualified jurisdictions by the NAIC, and each of Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci and RREAG has been approved as a “reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer” eligible for zero collateral in various states. NAIC Ratios. The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed property and casualty insurance companies. An insurance company may fall outside of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are themselves immaterial. Although generally the insurance industry is not directly regulated by the federal government, federal legislation and initiatives can affect the industry and our business.The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office, which does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, but has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements. Each party has been working to complete its internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) in order to satisfy the U.S.-EU covered agreement’s substantive and timing requirements. These standards include, among others, minimum capital and solvency or capital ratios, submission to U.S. jurisdictions by the non-U.S. reinsurers and prompt payment of reinsured claims."
Item 1,Lloyd’s Regulation,"General. The operations of RSML are subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the Lloyd’s Council. RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe CCL’s underwriting business at Lloyd’s. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution.
By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, RenaissanceRe CCL has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s bye-laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012.
Capital Requirements. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit, referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or “FAL,” in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the capital adequacy regime of the PRA. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. Under these requirements, Lloyd’s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. The amount of FAL for Syndicate 1458 is determined by Lloyd’s and is based on Syndicate 1458’s solvency and capital requirement as calculated through its internal model. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses, the Lloyd’s Central Fund provides an additional level of security for policyholders.
Restrictions. A Reinsurance to Close generally is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of a Reinsurance to Close, any profit from the syndicate’s operations for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s members. If the syndicate’s managing agency concludes that an appropriate Reinsurance to Close cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year, it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run-off. During this period, there cannot be a release of the Funds at Lloyd’s of a member of that syndicate without the consent of Lloyd’s.
The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the rating of the Lloyd’s market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL would be adversely affected if Lloyd’s current ratings were downgraded.
Intervention Powers. The Lloyd’s Council has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, withdraw a member’s permission to underwrite business or to underwrite a particular class of business. The Lloyd’s Council may change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd’s requirements or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member’s participation in a given underwriting year. If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, the member may obtain financial assistance from the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Lloyd’s Council has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.
While not currently material to our operations, Syndicate 1458 also accesses insurance business from the European Economic Area though the Lloyd’s Brussels Subsidiary. The Lloyd’s Brussels Subsidiary is authorized and regulated by the National Bank of Belgium and regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Authority.","RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s.

Item 7,OVERVIEW,"RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance. We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, managed funds and underwriting platforms around the world. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., RREAG, Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and our Lloyd’s syndicate, Syndicate 1458. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures, managed funds and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through Syndicate 1458 and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Syndicate 1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses, and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. We also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures, including DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Upsilon RFO and Vermeer. In addition, through Medici, we invest in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk.
Our mission is to match desirable, well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter. We believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term, and to protect communities and enable prosperity. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles, and keeping our promises. Our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We believe this metric is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance, and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time. The principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income, investment income, and fee income generated by our third-party capital management business.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance, and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we have cultivated strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of several initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products, and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business.
Our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance, although as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business, we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements. We also pursue a number of other opportunities, such as creating and managing our joint ventures and managed funds, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk, and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures or managed funds, or the acquisition of, or the investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies.
We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds.
The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate.
A meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. Our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers that are affected by these events.
We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover, which primarily impact our Property segment, in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. Our Casualty and Specialty business, which represents approximately half of our gross premiums written annually, is an efficient use of capital that is generally less correlated with our Property business. It allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations. We have created, and manage, multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.
Our revenues are principally derived from three sources: (1) net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell; (2) net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell; and (3) fees received from our joint ventures and managed funds.
Our expenses primarily consist of: (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell; (2) acquisition costs, which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write; (3) operating expenses, which primarily consist of personnel expenses, rent and other operating expenses; (4) corporate expenses, which include certain executive, legal and consulting expenses, costs for research and development, transaction and integration-related expenses, and other miscellaneous costs, including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company; (5) redeemable noncontrolling interests, which represent the interests of third parties with respect to the net income of DaVinciRe, Medici and Vermeer; and (6) interest and dividends related to our debt and preference shares. We are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal. In the future, our net tax exposure may increase as our operations expand geographically, or as a result of adverse tax developments.
The underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, and combined ratio. The net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses (acquisition expenses and operational expenses) by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. We also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on a current accident year basis and a prior accident years basis. The current accident year net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking current accident year net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned. The prior accident years net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking prior accident years net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned.","RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance.

The current accident year net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking current accident year net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned."
Item 7,Premiums and Related Expenses,"Premiums are recognized as income, net of any applicable reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased, over the terms of the related contracts and policies. Premiums written are based on contract and policy terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies. Unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of contracts and policies in force. Amounts are computed by pro rata methods based on statistical data or reports received from ceding companies. Reinstatement premiums are estimated after the occurrence of a loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses as well as reported and estimated reserves. Reinstatement premiums are earned when written.
Due to the nature of reinsurance, ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums to us subsequent to the contract coverage period. Consequently, premiums written and receivable include amounts reported by the ceding companies, supplemented by our estimates of premiums that are written but not reported. The estimation of written premiums may be affected by early cancellation, election of contract provisions for cut-off and return of unearned premiums or other contract disruptions. The time lag involved in the process of reporting premiums is shorter than the lag in reporting losses. In addition to estimating premiums written, we estimate the earned portion of premiums written which is subject to judgment and uncertainty. Any adjustments to written and earned premiums, and the related losses and acquisition expenses, are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made. 
Lines of business that are similar in both the nature of their business and estimation process may be grouped for purposes of estimating premiums. Premiums are estimated based on ceding company estimates and our own judgment after considering factors such as: (1) the ceding company’s historical premium versus projected premium, (2) the ceding company’s history of providing accurate estimates, (3) anticipated changes in the marketplace and the ceding company’s competitive position therein, (4) reported premiums to date and (5) the anticipated impact of proposed underwriting changes. Estimates of premiums written and earned are based on the selected ultimate premium estimate, the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts and the remaining exposure from the underlying policies. We evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates in light of the actual premium reported by the ceding companies, information obtained during audits and other information received from ceding companies.
We estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each premiums receivable based on the counterparty’s credit ratings. The percentages applied are based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates. We then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current expected credit losses based on other qualitative and judgmental factors. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s premiums receivable balance was $3.8 billion (2020 - $2.9 billion). Of the Company’s premiums receivable balance as of December 31, 2021, the majority are receivables from highly rated counterparties. At December 31, 2021, the Company held a provision for current expected credit losses on its premiums receivable of $2.8 million (2020 - $6.0 million).","Unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of contracts and policies in force.

At December 31, 2021, the Company’s premiums receivable balance was $3.8 billion (2020 - $2.9 billion)."
Item 7,Reinsurance Recoverable,"We enter into retrocessional reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related assumed reinsurance. For multi-year retrospectively rated contracts, we accrue amounts (either assets or liabilities) that are due to or from our retrocessionaires based on estimated contract experience. If we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate, such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined.
The estimate of reinsurance recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under the heading “Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” above. In particular, reinsurance recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance, industry losses reported by various statistical reporting services, and other factors. Reinsurance recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured industry losses that will be reported by the applicable statistical reporting agency, as per the contract terms. In addition, the level of our additional case reserves and IBNR reserves has a significant impact on reinsurance recoverable. These factors can impact the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverable to be recorded.
The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future. The amounts recoverable that will ultimately be collected are subject to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims at a future point in time, for reasons including insolvency or elective run-off, contractual dispute and various other reasons. In addition, because the majority of the balances recoverable will not be collected for some time, economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may change, and these changes may affect the reinsurer’s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us. To reflect these uncertainties, we estimate and record a provision for current expected credit losses for potential uncollectible reinsurance recoverable which reduces reinsurance recoverable and net income.
We estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each reinsurance recoverable based on our counterparty’s credit rating. The percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates. We then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current expected credit losses based on other qualitative and judgmental factors. At December 31, 2021, our reinsurance recoverable balance was $4.3 billion (2020 - $2.9 billion). Of this amount, 46.9% is fully collateralized by our reinsurers, 52.1% is recoverable from reinsurers rated A- or higher by major rating agencies and 1.0% is recoverable from reinsurers rated lower than A- by major rating agencies (2020 - 45.2%, 53.4% and 1.4%, respectively). The reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for 19.9%, 8.4% and 4.3%, respectively, of our reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 15.3%, 10.8% and 6.7%, respectively). The provision for current expected credit losses recorded against reinsurance recoverable was $8.3 million at December 31, 2021 (2020 - $6.3 million). The three largest company-specific components of the provision for current expected credit losses represented 18.0%, 13.9% and 11.2%, respectively, of our total provision for current expected credit losses at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 13.2%, 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively).

The provision for current expected credit losses recorded against reinsurance recoverable was $8.3 million at December 31, 2021 (2020 - $6.3 million)."
Item 7,Fair Value,"The use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our consolidated financial statements. Fair value is defined under accounting guidance currently applicable to us to be the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date. We recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.
FASB ASC Topic Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures prescribes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the respective valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable (Level 3).
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
In order to determine if a market is active or inactive for a security, we consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the volume of trading activity for the security in question, the price of the security compared to its par value (for fixed maturity investments), and other factors that may be indicative of market activity. 
At December 31, 2021, we classified $169.3 million and $10.8 million of our assets and liabilities, respectively, at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. This represented 0.5% and 0.0% of our total assets and liabilities, respectively. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. We use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may be unobservable, to value these Level 3 assets and liabilities.","The use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, subject to impairment, and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, subject to impairment. If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. We recognized identifiable finite lived intangible assets of $11.2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average period of 10.5 years, identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets of $6.8 million, and certain other adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and shareholders’ equity of TMR at March 22, 2019, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019.
In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). Goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets.
We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For purposes of the annual impairment evaluation, we assess qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances exist that would lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we do not perform a quantitative evaluation. Should we determine that a quantitative analysis is required, we will first determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that with the carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then proceed to determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to, and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions. Other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and a related charge in our consolidated statements of operations. An impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable. In the event we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, an accounting charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.
As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined that there was no impairment during 2021, and therefore the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information with respect to the impairment.
As at December 31, 2021, excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures, under the equity method, as noted below, our consolidated balance sheets include $210.9 million of goodwill (2020 - $211.0 million) and $32.6 million of other intangible assets (2020 - $38.6 million). Impairment charges related to these balances were $Nil during the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020 - $6.8 million, 2019 - $Nil). In the future, it is possible we will hold more goodwill and intangible assets, which would increase the degree of judgment and uncertainty embedded in our financial statements, and potentially increase the volatility of our reported results.","If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. We recognized identifiable finite lived intangible assets of $11.2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average period of 10.5 years, identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets of $6.8 million, and certain other adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and shareholders’ equity of TMR at March 22, 2019, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019. In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we do not perform a quantitative evaluation. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and a related charge in our consolidated statements of operations. In the event we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, an accounting charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded. As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined that there was no impairment during 2021, and therefore the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2021. Impairment charges related to these balances were $Nil during the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020 - $6.8 million, 2019 - $Nil)."
Item 7,"Investments in Other Ventures, Under Equity Method","Investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures, under equity method, and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in our results for the period. Any decline in the value of investments in other ventures, under equity method, including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee, considered by management to be other-than-temporary, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined. As of December 31, 2021, we had $98.1 million (2020 - $98.4 million) in investments in other ventures, under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets, including $9.9 million of goodwill and $8.7 million of other intangible assets (2020 - $10.6 million and $12.4 million). The carrying value of our investments in other ventures, under equity method, individually or in the aggregate, may, and likely will, differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so.
In determining whether an equity method investment is impaired, we take into consideration a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee, the investee’s future business plans and projections, recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available, discussions with the investee’s management, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value. Accordingly, we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change, this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments. This would cause us to write-down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken. We do not have any current plans to dispose of these investments, and cannot assure you we will consummate future transactions in which we realize the value at which these holdings are reflected in our financial statements. We have not recorded any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our investments in other ventures, under the equity method in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. See “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.","Investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures, under equity method, and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Item 7,Income Taxes,"Income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Such temporary differences are primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards and GAAP versus tax basis accounting differences relating to unearned premiums, reserves for claims and claim expenses, deferred finance charges, deferred underwriting results, accrued expenses, investments, deferred acquisition expenses, intangible assets, amortization and depreciation and VOBA. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change in tax rates is enacted. A valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized.
At December 31, 2021, our net deferred tax asset (prior to our valuation allowance) and valuation allowance were $192.4 million (2020 - $138.0 million) and $131.5 million (2020 - $88.7 million), respectively. See “Note 15. Taxation” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. At each balance sheet date, we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance assessment is performed separately in each taxable jurisdiction based on all available information including projections of future GAAP taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance relates to a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions in which we do business. It excludes Bermuda and our U.S. operations that existed prior to the acquisition of TMR, which only have a small valuation allowance against finite lived tax carryforwards.
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $Nil as of December 31, 2021 (2020 - $Nil). Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, would be recognized in income tax expense. At December 31, 2021, interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were $Nil (2020 - $Nil).
The following filed income tax returns are open for examination with the applicable tax authorities: tax years 2018 through 2020 with the IRS; 2017 through 2020 with Ireland; 2019 through 2020 with the U.K.; 2017 through 2020 with Singapore; 2019 and 2020 with Switzerland; and 2017 through 2020 with Australia. We do not expect the resolution of these open years to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial condition.","The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change in tax rates is enacted.

Item 7,Property Gross Premiums Written,"In 2021, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $959.6 million, or 32.0%, to $4.0 billion, compared to $3.0 billion in 2020.
Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $349.0 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020. The increase in gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business included $339.7 million of reinstatement premiums associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses, compared to reinstatement premiums of $77.0 million associated with the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and $25.9 million associated with COVID-19 losses in 2020. The growth in 2021 was also driven by an improved rate environment, increased shares on existing deals, participation in new deals and opportunities across underwriting platforms.
Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $610.6 million, or 54.9%, compared to 2020. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by rate improvements which contributed to growth in new and existing business written in the current and prior periods across underwriting platforms. This included growth in catastrophe exposed U.S. property excess and surplus lines.
In 2020, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $568.2 million, or 23.4%, to $3.0 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019.
Gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business were $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $291.3 million, or 18.3%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business in 2020 was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions, certain new transactions, rate improvements and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
Gross premiums written in our other property class of business were $1.1 billion in 2020, an increase of $276.8 million, or 33.1%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in our other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of our underwriting platforms, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
As our other property class of business has become a larger percentage of our Property segment gross premiums written, the amount of proportional business has increased. Proportional business typically has a higher expense ratio and combined ratio than traditional excess of loss reinsurance.
Our Property segment gross premiums written continue to be characterized by a large percentage of U.S. and Caribbean premium, as we have found business derived from exposures in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world to be, in general, less attractive on a risk-adjusted basis during recent periods. A significant amount of our U.S. and Caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms, notably U.S. Atlantic windstorms, as well as earthquakes and other natural and man-made catastrophes.","Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $349.0 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020.

The increase in gross premiums written in our other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of our underwriting platforms, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR."
Item 7,Property Ceded Premiums Written,"Ceded premiums written in our Property segment increased 13.4%, to $1.1 billion, in 2021, compared to $961.9 million in 2020. The increase in ceded premiums written was primarily driven by higher gross premiums written in 2021, which were ceded to Upsilon RFO, and ceded reinstatement premiums earned of $54.7 million associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses.
Ceded premiums written in our Property segment increased $185.2 million, to $961.9 million, in 2020, compared to $776.7 million in 2019. The increase in ceded premiums written was principally due to certain of the gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business noted above being ceded to third-party investors in our managed vehicles, primarily Upsilon RFO, as well as an overall increase in ceded purchases as part of the Company’s gross-to-net strategy.
Due to the potential volatility of the reinsurance contracts which we sell, we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio. To the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available, we anticipate continued use of retrocessional reinsurance to reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk; however, the buying of ceded reinsurance in our Property segment is based on market opportunities and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year. In addition, in future periods, we may utilize the growing market for insurance-linked securities to expand our purchases of retrocessional reinsurance if we find the pricing and terms of such coverages attractive.
Property Underwriting Results
Our Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $185.5 million in 2021, compared to underwriting income of $11.0 million in 2020, a decrease of $196.5 million. In 2021, our Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 82.9%, an underwriting expense ratio of 24.2% and a combined ratio of 107.1%, compared to 74.2%, 25.2% and 99.4%, respectively, in 2020.
Principally impacting the Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2021 were the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $1.4 billion and added 58.6 percentage points to the combined ratio. In comparison, 2020 was impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $651.9 million and added 35.0 percentage points to the combined ratio, and COVID-19 losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $235.0 million and added 12.3 percentage points to the combined ratio.
The net claims and claim expense ratio for prior accident years reflected net favorable development of 15.3% for the catastrophe class of business and 2.4% for the other property class of business, primarily related to weather-related large losses in the 2017 to 2019 accident years. The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.0 percentage point, principally driven by improved operating leverage, through higher net premiums earned, including $293.3 million of net reinstatement premiums earned associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses.
Our Property segment generated underwriting income of $11.0 million in 2020, compared to $209.3 million in 2019, a decrease of $198.1 million. In 2020, our Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 74.2%, an underwriting expense ratio of 25.2% and a combined ratio of 99.4%, compared to 59.3%, 27.8% and 87.1%, respectively, in 2019.
Principally impacting the Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2020 were the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $651.9 million and added 35.0 percentage points to the combined ratio, and COVID-19 losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $235.0 million and added 12.3 percentage points to the combined ratio. Partially offsetting the impact of the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years of $157.3 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded recoveries. This favorable development reduced the Property segment combined ratio by 8.1 percentage points. In comparison, 2019 was principally impacted by the 2019 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $414.4 million and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 26.7 percentage points.

Item 7,Casualty and Specialty Ceded Premiums Written,"Ceded premiums written in our Casualty and Specialty segment increased by 7.5%, to $803.7 million, in 2021, compared to $747.9 million in 2020, primarily driven by the increase in gross premiums written subject to our retrocessional quota share reinsurance programs.
Ceded premiums written in our Casualty and Specialty segment increased by $98.4 million, to $747.9 million, in 2020, compared to $649.5 million in 2019, primarily resulting from increased gross premiums written subject to our retrocessional quota share reinsurance programs.
As in our Property segment, the buying of ceded reinsurance in our Casualty and Specialty segment is based on market opportunities and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year.
Casualty and Specialty Underwriting Results
Our Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $76.6 million in 2021, compared to an underwriting loss of $87.5 million in 2020. In 2021, our Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 66.2%, an underwriting expense ratio of 30.8% and a combined ratio of 97.0%, compared to 73.8%, 30.5% and 104.3%, respectively, in 2020. The underwriting loss in 2020 was principally driven by net claims and claim expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic of $122.1 million, which added 6.1 percentage points to the net claims and claim expense ratio during 2020.
The decrease in the Casualty and Specialty segment combined ratio in 2021 was principally driven by a decrease of 7.6 percentage points in the net claims and claim expense ratio, driven by lower current accident year losses, as compared to 2020 which was impacted by losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our Casualty and Specialty segment experienced net favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses of $16.1 million, or 0.7 percentage points, during 2021. The net favorable development during 2021 was driven by reported losses generally coming in lower than expected on attritional net claims and claim expenses. See “Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to the development of prior accident years net claims and claim expenses.
The underwriting expense ratio in 2021 was comparable to 2020 and included an increase in the net acquisition expense ratio, principally due to the effects of purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition of TMR, which improved the ratio in 2020, largely offset by a decrease in the operating expense ratio due to continued improvement in operating leverage.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.5 million in 2020, compared to underwriting income of $46.0 million in 2019. The underwriting loss in 2020 was driven by the COVID-19 losses. In 2020, our Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 73.8%, an underwriting expense ratio of 30.5% and a combined ratio of 104.3%, compared to 66.1%, 31.2% and 97.3%, respectively, in 2019.
The increase in the combined ratio in 2020 was principally driven by net claims and claim expenses associated with the COVID-19 losses of $122.1 million, which added 6.1 percentage points to the net claims and claim expense ratio during 2020.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment experienced net favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses of $26.8 million, or 1.4 percentage points, during 2020, compared to $23.9 million, or 1.4 percentage points, respectively, in 2019. The net favorable development during 2020 and 2019 was principally driven by reported losses coming in lower than expected.

Refer to “Part II, Item 7."
Item 7,Net Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses),"In 2021, net foreign exchange losses were $41.0 million compared to a $27.8 million net foreign exchange gain in 2020. The net foreign exchange loss was primarily driven by losses attributable to third party investors in Medici which are allocated through noncontrolling interest and miscellaneous foreign exchange losses generated by our underwriting activities.
In 2020, net foreign exchange gains were $27.8 million compared to net foreign exchange losses of $2.9 million in 2019. The net foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by gains attributable to third-party investors in Medici, miscellaneous foreign exchange gains generated by our underwriting activities, and foreign exchange gains attributable to our operations with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies.
Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We routinely write a portion of our business in currencies other than U.S. dollars and invest a portion of our cash and investment portfolio in those currencies. In addition, and in connection with the acquisition of TMR, we acquired certain entities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. As a result, we may experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our consolidated financial statements. We are primarily impacted by the foreign currency risk exposures associated with our underwriting operations and our investment portfolio, and may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities.
Refer to “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information related to our exposure to foreign currency risk and “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to foreign currency forward and option contracts we have entered into.","The net foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by gains attributable to third-party investors in Medici, miscellaneous foreign exchange gains generated by our underwriting activities, and foreign exchange gains attributable to our operations with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies.

Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to foreign currency forward and option contracts we have entered into."
Item 7,Income Tax (Expense) Benefit,"We are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate; however, since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal.
In 2021, we recognized an income tax benefit of $10.7 million, compared to an income tax expense of $2.9 million in 2020. The income tax benefit in 2021 was principally driven by unrealized investment portfolio losses in our taxable jurisdictions, while the income tax expense in the prior comparative period was principally driven by unrealized investment gains in our U.S. based operations.
In 2020, we recognized an income tax expense of $2.9 million, compared to $17.2 million in 2019. The reduction in income tax expense was principally driven by lower underwriting performance, partially offset by higher investment gains, primarily in our U.S.-based operations.
At December 31, 2021, our net deferred tax asset (after valuation allowance) totaled $60.9 million. Our operations in Ireland, the U.K., Singapore, Switzerland and the U.S. operations of TMR have historically produced GAAP taxable losses and we currently do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to recover the predominant amount of our net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. Our valuation allowance totaled $131.5 million and $88.7 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate, which we calculate as income tax (expense) benefit divided by income or loss before taxes, may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the geographic distribution of pre-tax income or loss in any given period between different jurisdictions with comparatively higher tax rates and those with comparatively lower tax rates. The geographic distribution of pre-tax income or loss can vary significantly between periods due to, but not limited to, the following factors: the business mix of net premiums written and earned; the size and nature of net claims and claim expenses incurred; the amount and geographic location of operating expenses, net investment income, net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments; outstanding debt and related interest expense; and the amount of specific adjustments to determine the income tax basis in each of our operating jurisdictions. In addition, a significant portion of our gross and net premiums are currently written and earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, including the majority of our catastrophe business, which can result in significant volatility to our pre-tax income or loss in any given period. We expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in the future, as our global operations outside of Bermuda expand. In addition, it is possible we could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulation, or enforcement, any of which could increase our effective tax rate more rapidly or steeply than we currently anticipate.
Generally, the preponderance of our revenue and pre-tax income or loss is generated by our domestic (i.e., Bermuda) operations, in the form of underwriting income or loss and net investment income or loss, rather than our foreign operations. However, the geographic distribution of pre-tax income or loss can vary significantly between periods for a variety of reasons, including the business mix of net premiums written and earned, the size and nature of net claims and claim expenses incurred, the amount and geographic location of operating expenses, net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the amount of specific adjustments to determine the income tax basis in each of our operating jurisdictions. Pre-tax income for our domestic operations was higher compared to our foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 primarily as a result of the more volatile catastrophe business underwritten in our Bermuda operations during these periods incurring a comparatively lower level of catastrophe losses and thus generating higher levels of net underwriting income than our foreign operations, which underwrite primarily less volatile business with higher attritional net claims and claim expenses and as a result produce lower levels of net underwriting income in benign loss years.","We are subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate; however, since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal. In 2020, we recognized an income tax expense of $2.9 million, compared to $17.2 million in 2019. The reduction in income tax expense was principally driven by lower underwriting performance, partially offset by higher investment gains, primarily in our U.S.-based operations. In addition, a significant portion of our gross and net premiums are currently written and earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, including the majority of our catastrophe business, which can result in significant volatility to our pre-tax income or loss in any given period. Generally, the preponderance of our revenue and pre-tax income or loss is generated by our domestic (i.e., Bermuda) operations, in the form of underwriting income or loss and net investment income or loss, rather than our foreign operations. However, the geographic distribution of pre-tax income or loss can vary significantly between periods for a variety of reasons, including the business mix of net premiums written and earned, the size and nature of net claims and claim expenses incurred, the amount and geographic location of operating expenses, net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the amount of specific adjustments to determine the income tax basis in each of our operating jurisdictions."
Item 7,Financial Condition,"As a Bermuda-domiciled holding company, RenaissanceRe has limited operations of its own. Its assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries and cash and securities in amounts which fluctuate over time. We therefore rely on dividends and distributions (and other statutorily permissible payments) from our subsidiaries, investment income and fee income to meet our liquidity requirements, which primarily include making principal and interest payments on our debt and dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders.
The payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is, under certain circumstances, limited by the applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate In addition, insurance laws require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. We believe that each of our insurance subsidiaries and branches exceeded the minimum solvency, capital and surplus requirements in their applicable jurisdictions at December 31, 2021. Certain of our subsidiaries and branches are required to file FCRs, with their regulators, which provide details on solvency and financial performance. Where required, these FCRs will be posted on our website. The regulations governing our and our principal operating subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity and requirements to file FCRs are discussed in detail in “Part I, Item 1. Business—Regulation” and “Note 18. Statutory Requirements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”","We believe that each of our insurance subsidiaries and branches exceeded the minimum solvency, capital and surplus requirements in their applicable jurisdictions at December 31, 2021.

Statutory Requirements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”"
Item 7,Holding Company Liquidity,"RenaissanceRe’s principal uses of liquidity are: (1) common share related transactions including dividend payments to our common shareholders and common share repurchases, (2) preference share related transactions including dividend payments to our preference shareholders and preference share redemptions, (3) interest and principal payments on debt, (4) capital investments in our subsidiaries, (5) acquisition of new or existing companies or businesses and (6) certain corporate and operating expenses.
We attempt to structure our organization in a way that facilitates efficient capital movements between RenaissanceRe and our operating subsidiaries and to ensure that adequate liquidity is available when required, giving consideration to applicable laws and regulations, and the domiciliary location of sources of liquidity and related obligations. For example, our internal investment structures and cash pooling arrangements among the Company and certain of our subsidiaries help to efficiently facilitate capital and liquidity movements.
In the aggregate, our principal operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us. In addition, our subsidiaries maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid securities, which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise. However, in some circumstances, RenaissanceRe may determine it is necessary or advisable to contribute capital to our subsidiaries, or may be contractually required to contribute capital to our joint ventures or managed funds. For example, during 2019, RenaissanceRe contributed capital to RenaissanceRe Specialty Holdings (UK) Limited to fund the acquisition of TMR and made a capital contribution to Renaissance Reinsurance to increase its shareholders’ equity to support growth in premiums, and in 2020, RenaissanceRe contributed capital to RREAG to support growth in premiums. In addition, from time to time we invest in new managed joint ventures or managed funds, increase our investments in certain of our managed joint ventures or managed funds and contribute cash to investment subsidiaries. In certain instances, we are required to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries, for example, Renaissance Reinsurance is obligated to make a mandatory capital contribution of up to $50.0 million in the event that a loss reduces Top Layer Re’s capital below a specified level.","We attempt to structure our organization in a way that facilitates efficient capital movements between RenaissanceRe and our operating subsidiaries and to ensure that adequate liquidity is available when required, giving consideration to applicable laws and regulations, and the domiciliary location of sources of liquidity and related obligations.

Item 7,Sources of Liquidity,"Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting primarily of premiums, investment income and fee income, have provided sufficient funds to pay the losses and operating expenses incurred by our subsidiaries and to fund dividends and distributions to RenaissanceRe. Other potential sources of liquidity include borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of securities. For example, in July 2021, we raised $488.7 million of net proceeds in an underwritten public offering of Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of 4.20% Series G Preference Shares.
The premiums received by our operating subsidiaries are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses generally are received within the first two years of inception of a contract, while operating expenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. It generally takes much longer for net claims and claims expenses incurred to be reported and ultimately settled, requiring the establishment of reserves for claims and claim expenses and losses recoverable. Therefore, the amount of net claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net claims and claims expenses incurred in that year, as reported in the consolidated statement of operations.
While we expect that our liquidity needs will continue to be met by our cash receipts from operations, relatively low investment yields, and the nature of our business where a large portion of the coverages we provide can produce losses of high severity and low frequency, future cash flows from operating activities cannot be accurately predicted and may fluctuate significantly between individual quarters and years. In addition, due to the magnitude and complexity of certain large loss events, meaningful uncertainty remains regarding losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary materially from preliminary estimates, which would impact our cash flows from operations.
Our “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act allows for the public offering of various types of securities, including common shares, preference shares and debt securities, which provides a source of liquidity. Because we are a “well-known seasoned issuer” as defined by the rules promulgated under the Securities Act, we are also eligible to file additional automatically effective registration statements on Form S-3 in the future for the potential offering and sale of additional debt and equity securities.","The premiums received by our operating subsidiaries are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums.

Item 1A,Risks Related to our (Re)insurance Business,"We have substantial exposure to natural and non-natural catastrophic events and circumstances, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, winter storms, freezes, floods, fires, tornadoes, hailstorms, drought, pandemics, cyber-risks, political unrest, war, riots and acts of terrorism. Historically, a relatively large percentage of our coverage exposures has been concentrated in natural disasters in the U.S. Southeast or West Coast, but we have significant exposure to large catastrophic events globally. As a result, our operating results have historically been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly affected by the frequency and severity of loss events.
The occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of catastrophic events, the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable, may cause significant volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results and may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we believe that certain factors may continue to increase the number and severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future, including increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, increasing risks associated with extreme weather events because of changes in climate conditions and sea-level rise, and the effects of higher-than-expected inflation.
Our largest estimated economic exposures arise from natural disasters and other catastrophes. We believe the trend towards increased severity and frequency of weather-related natural disasters and catastrophes arises in part from climate change. In addition, we believe that climate change and shifting demographic trends in catastrophe exposed regions each contributes to increases in the average economic value of expected losses. Further, we believe that the recent increase in catastrophic events is indicative of permanent climate change rather than transient climate variability.
A substantial portion of our property coverages may be adversely impacted by climate change. While we have invested heavily to understand the influence of climate change on the weather and its impact on the risks that we take, we cannot predict with certainty the frequency or severity of tropical cyclones, wildfires or other natural catastrophes, and our risk assessments may not accurately reflect shifting environmental and climate related risks. Unanticipated factors could lead to additional insured losses that exceed our current estimates, resulting in disruptions to or adverse impacts on our business, the market, or our clients. Further, some of our investments, such as catastrophe-linked securities and property catastrophe joint ventures or managed funds, could also be adversely impacted by climate change.
Our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. Our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates of these potential losses. We use actuarial and computer models, historical reinsurance and insurance industry loss statistics, and management’s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense reserves. Ssee “Part I, Item 1. Business—Underwriting and Enterprise Risk Management.” Our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available, as new or improved methodologies are developed, as loss trends and claims inflation impact future payments, or as rules and regulations change.
Due to the assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves, they are inherently uncertain. As information emerges and losses are paid, we expect that some of our assumptions or estimates will change, perhaps materially, and that our actual net claims and claim expenses paid and reported will differ, perhaps materially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. For example, our significant gross and net reserves associated with the large catastrophe events of the past several years, as well as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, remain subject to significant uncertainty.
If we determine that our claims and claim expense reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase these reserves at the time of the determination and take income statement charges, reducing our net income and available capital. Conversely, if our reserving estimates are too conservative, it could impede our ability to grow our business. Our claims reserves are large, and a small percentage increase to those liabilities could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
Unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social conditions could result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance and reinsurance contracts. These developments and changes may adversely affect us, perhaps materially, by, for example, imposing additional coverage obligations beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims to which we are subject. We believe that our property results have been adversely impacted over recent periods by increasing fraud and abuses at the primary claims level, as well as other forms of social inflation, and that these trends may continue. Assignment of benefits practices, particularly in Florida, have resulted in increases in the size and number of claims and incidences of litigation, which may directly affect us through policies we write or by reducing the value of investments we have in Florida domestic reinsurers.
These legal and social changes and their impact may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence, particularly with respect to our casualty and specialty business. Our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by social inflation trends, including increased litigation, expanded theories of liability and higher jury awards.
The full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claims and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict. As a result, the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Furthermore, we expect that our exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our casualty business grows, because in these “long-tail” lines claims can typically be made for many years, making them more susceptible to these trends than our property and specialty businesses, which are generally more “short-tail.”
We market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide through a limited number of insurance and reinsurance brokers. As a result, the loss of a broker, through a merger, acquisition or otherwise, could result in the loss of a substantial portion of our business, which would reduce our premium volume and could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, due to the concentration of our brokers, they may have increased power to dictate the terms and conditions of our arrangements with them, which could have a negative impact on our business.
The (re)insurance industry has historically been cyclical by product and market. After experiencing a prolonged soft market cycle over the last several years, we believe that the current (re)insurance underwriting market is in a hard market phase for many lines of business, characterized by increasing prices and improving terms and conditions. This shift has likely been caused by recent withdrawals of alternative capital, the number of multiple catastrophic events and continuing prior year adverse development. We cannot assure you that this increase in premium rates will continue, and rates may decrease in the future. If demand for our products falls or the supply of competing capacity rises, our prospects for potential growth may be adversely affected. In particular, we might lose existing customers or suffer a decline in business during shifting market cycles, which we might not regain when industry conditions improve.
We believe the hard/soft market cycle dynamic is likely to persist, and that we may return to soft market conditions in the future. Additionally, it is possible that increased access of primary insurers to capital, new technologies and other factors may reduce the duration or eliminate or significantly lessen the impact of any current or future hard reinsurance underwriting market. The cumulative impact of these risks could negatively impact our profitability and ability to maintain or grow premiums.
The retrocessional reinsurance that we purchase for our own account is generally subject to annual renewal, and market conditions may. Recent large catastrophe events have limited and may continue to limit or prevent us from obtaining desired amounts of new or replacement coverage on favorable terms or from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. This could limit the amount of business we are willing to write or decrease the protection available to us following large loss events.
When we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account, complex coverage issues or coverage disputes may impede our ability to collect amounts we believe we are owed. We have significant reinsurance recoverable associated with the large catastrophe events of the past several years, and the insolvency of any of our reinsurers, or the inability or reluctance of any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements, could have a material adverse effect on us.
In addition, a large portion of our reinsurance protection is concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers, which could increase credit risk and may make it difficult to negotiate favorable terms and conditions. The risk of such concentration of retrocessional coverage may be increased by recent and future consolidation within the industry.
We do not separately underwrite each primary risk assumed under our reinsurance contracts or pursuant to our delegated authority business. Accordingly, we are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies and delegated authority counterparties, who may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured. As a result, the premiums they cede to us may not properly compensate us for the risks we assume, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, it is possible that our delegated authority counterparties or other counterparties authorized to bind policies on our behalf will fail to comply with regulatory requirements, such as those relating to sanctions, or our own standards regarding underwriting and reputational risk tolerance, which could lead to increased regulatory and operational burden, among other risks. We expect the amount of business we write through delegated authority counterparties to continue to increase, and to the extent we continue to increase the proportional coverages we offer, we will increase our aggregate exposure to risks of this nature.
Financial strength ratings are used by ceding companies and reinsurance intermediaries to assess the financial strength and quality of reinsurers and insurers. Rating agencies evaluate us periodically and may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings if we do not continue to meet their criteria. In addition, rating agencies may make changes in their capital models and rating methodologies, which could increase the amount of capital required to support our ratings. In December 2021, S&P announced proposed changes to its rating methodologies. The proposed changes have not been finalized, so the impact, if any, these changes may have on our ratings is unknown.
A ratings downgrade or other negative ratings action could adversely affect our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers, the marketability of our product offerings, access to and cost of borrowing, and ability to write new business. We could also breach covenants under, or incur higher borrowing costs on, our credit facilities. In addition, if we are downgraded below a certain rating level, nearly all of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions permitting cedants to cancel coverage and/or requiring us to post collateral for our obligations.
For the current ratings of certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and additional ratings information, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ratings.”
Competition and consolidation in the (re)insurance industry could adversely impact us. We compete with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, many of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. In addition, pension funds, endowments, investment banks, investment managers, exchanges, hedge funds and other capital markets participants have become increasingly active in the reinsurance market, either through the formation of reinsurance companies or the use of other financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. We may also face competition from non-traditional competitors, as well as Insurtech start-up companies and others who aim to leverage access to “big data,” artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies to gain a competitive advantage.
We expect competition to continue to increase over time. It is possible that new or alternative capital could cause reductions in prices of our products or reduce the duration or amplitude of attractive portions of the historical market cycles. New entrants or existing competitors, which may include government sponsored funds or other vehicles, may attempt to replicate all or part of our business model and provide further competition in the markets in which we participate. We will also need to continue to invest significant time and resources in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services in order to maintain our competitive position.
Along with increased competition, there has also been significant consolidation in the (re)insurance industry over the last several years, including among our competitors, customers and brokers. These consolidated enterprises may try to use their enhanced market power or better capitalization to negotiate price reductions for our products and services or obtain a larger market share through increased line sizes. If competitive pressures decrease the prices for our products, we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities, resulting in lower premium volume and profitability.
As the insurance industry consolidates, we expect competition for customers to become more intense, and sourcing and properly servicing each customer to become even more important. We could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention, further reducing our operating margins. In addition, insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated, larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance.
Reinsurance intermediaries may also continue to consolidate, potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business and distribute our products. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business or results of operations.
Our premiums are prone to significant volatility due to factors including the timing of contract inception, as well as our differentiated strategy and capability that position us to pursue potentially non-recurring bespoke or large solutions for clients. In addition, after a large catastrophic event or circumstance, we may record significant amounts of reinstatement premium, which can cause quarterly, non-recurring fluctuations in both our written and earned premiums in our Property segment.","We have substantial exposure to natural and non-natural catastrophic events and circumstances, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, winter storms, freezes, floods, fires, tornadoes, hailstorms, drought, pandemics, cyber-risks, political unrest, war, riots and acts of terrorism.

Item 1A,Risks Related to our Strategy and Operations,"Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team may strain our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, or make it more difficult to retain customers, attract or maintain our capital support, or meet other needs of our business. This risk may be particularly acute for us relative to some of our competitors because some of our senior executives work in countries where they are not citizens (such as Bermuda) and work permit and immigration issues could adversely affect the ability to retain or hire key persons.
Cybersecurity threats and incidents have increased in recent years, and we may be subject to heightened cyber-related risks, in part due to the extended period of remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business depends on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems and our proprietary systems. We are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including brokers, clients, vendors and others with whom we do business, as well as with our Board of Directors. We cannot guarantee that the controls and procedures we or third parties have in place to protect or recover our systems and information will be effective, successful or sufficiently rapid to avoid harm to our business.
Security breaches, including at third parties that have our information, could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents, such as ransomware attacks, that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems could have a significant impact on our operations and financial results. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable cybersecurity and privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or expose sensitive customer data, or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. While management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations, there can be no assurances that a cybersecurity incident that could have a material impact on us will not occur in the future.
The cybersecurity regulatory environment is evolving, and it is likely that the costs of complying with new or developing regulatory requirements will increase. In addition, we operate in a number of jurisdictions with strict data privacy and other related laws, which could be violated in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident or in the event of noncompliance by our personnel. Failure to comply with these obligations can give rise to fines and other penalties, which could be significant.
See “Part I, Item 1. Business—Information Technology and Cybersecurity” for additional information related to information technology and cybersecurity.
We frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make strategic investments in new or other businesses. The negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business could be unsuccessful, result in a substantial diversion of management resources, or lead to other unanticipated risks or challenges. In addition, while our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance, as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business, we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements. risks associated with implementing or changing our business strategies and initiatives, including risks related to developing or enhancing our operations, controls and other infrastructure, may not have an impact on our publicly reported results until many years after implementation. Our failure to carry out our business plans may have an adverse effect on our long-term results of operations and financial condition.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including claims and claim expense reserves), shareholders’ equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to premiums written and earned, our net claims and claim expenses, investment valuations and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience, where possible, and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our judgments and estimates may not reflect, and may deviate materially from, our actual results. For more details on our estimates and judgments, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”
Our operating subsidiaries owe certain legal duties and obligations (including reporting, governance and allocation obligations) to third-party investors and are subject to laws and regulations relating to the management of third-party capital. Complying with these obligations, laws and regulations requires significant management time and attention. Faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established policies and procedures could result in our failure to comply with applicable obligations, laws or regulations, which could result in significant liabilities, penalties or other losses to us and seriously harm our business and results of operations.
In addition, our third-party capital providers may, subject to restrictions, redeem their interests in our joint ventures and managed funds or we may be unable to attract and raise additional third-party capital for our existing or potential new joint ventures and managed funds. The loss, or alteration in a negative manner, of any of this capital support could cause us to forego fee income and other income-generating opportunities and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract and raise additional third-party capital for our existing joint ventures and managed funds or for potential new joint ventures and managed funds and therefore we may forego existing and/or potentially attractive.
We have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness primarily consists of publicly traded notes, letters of credit and a revolving credit facility. For more details on our indebtedness, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Resources.”
The agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to make particular types of investments or other restricted payments, sell or place a lien on our or their respective assets, merge or consolidate. Some of these agreements also require us or our subsidiaries to maintain specific financial ratios or contain cross-defaults to our other indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, if we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios, the noteholders or the lenders could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them or, where applicable, cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit or, where the reimbursement obligations are unsecured, require us to pledge collateral or, where the reimbursement obligations are secured, require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral.
The determination of impairments taken on our investments, investments in other ventures, goodwill and other intangible assets and loans varies by type of asset and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. We cannot assure you that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore, management may determine that impairments are needed in future periods and any such impairment will be recorded in the period in which it occurs, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.","Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team may strain our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, or make it more difficult to retain customers, attract or maintain our capital support, or meet other needs of our business. Cybersecurity threats and incidents have increased in recent years, and we may be subject to heightened cyber-related risks, in part due to the extended period of remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, cyber incidents, such as ransomware attacks, that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems could have a significant impact on our operations and financial results. Failure to comply with these obligations can give rise to fines and other penalties, which could be significant. In addition, while our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance, as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business, we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements. risks associated with implementing or changing our business strategies and initiatives, including risks related to developing or enhancing our operations, controls and other infrastructure, may not have an impact on our publicly reported results until many years after implementation. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including claims and claim expense reserves), shareholders’ equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, where possible, and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For more details on our estimates and judgments, see “Part II, Item 7. Faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established policies and procedures could result in our failure to comply with applicable obligations, laws or regulations, which could result in significant liabilities, penalties or other losses to us and seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, our third-party capital providers may, subject to restrictions, redeem their interests in our joint ventures and managed funds or we may be unable to attract and raise additional third-party capital for our existing or potential new joint ventures and managed funds. The loss, or alteration in a negative manner, of any of this capital support could cause us to forego fee income and other income-generating opportunities and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract and raise additional third-party capital for our existing joint ventures and managed funds or for potential new joint ventures and managed funds and therefore we may forego existing and/or potentially attractive. We have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. We cannot assure you that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments."
Item 1A,Risks Related to the Economic Environment,"We have historically derived a meaningful portion of our income from our invested assets, which are principally comprised of fixed maturity securities. Accordingly, our financial results are subject to a variety of investment risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, inflation, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. The volatility in global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the value of our investment portfolio and our strategic investments. Additionally, some of our investments are subject to pre-payment or reinvestment risk. Our investment portfolio also includes securities with a longer duration, which may be more susceptible to risks such as inflation. Changes in various factors, including prevailing interest rates and credit spreads may cause fluctuations in the market value of our fixed maturity investments. Any decline in interest rates or continuation of a low interest rate environment could reduce our investment yield, which would reduce our overall profitability. Conversely, increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease, which could reduce our capital resources. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation levels, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control.
A portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other classes of investments including equity securities, catastrophe bonds, term loans and interests in alternative investment vehicles such as private equity investments, private credit investments, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds. For certain investments, the valuation on our consolidated balance sheet may differ significantly from the values that would be used if ready markets existed for the securities representing interests in the relevant investment vehicles. If we were to sell these assets (which may be necessary if we need liquidity to pay claims), it may be at significantly lower prices than we have recorded them. Furthermore, our interests in many of the investment classes described above are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term. The performance of these classes of investments is also dependent on individual investment managers and investment strategies. It is possible that these investment managers will leave, the investment strategies will become ineffective or that the managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines. Our investment portfolio may become concentrated in a limited number of issuers or have significant exposure to certain geographic areas or economic sectors. Concentration of investments can increase investment risk and portfolio volatility. Any of the foregoing could result in a decline in our investment performance and capital resources, and accordingly, adversely affect our financial results.
The principal markets in which we operate are susceptible to monetary inflation, which could cause loss costs to increase, impact the performance of our investment portfolio, and borrowing costs to increase. We believe the risks of inflation across our key markets have increased. In particular, the steps taken by governments in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the costs of such actions, have led to significant inflation. The impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are long tail in nature, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims. Changes in the level of inflation may also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of loss reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business, and may require us to strengthen reserves, with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Unanticipated higher inflation could also lead to higher interest rates, which would negatively impact the value of our fixed income securities and potentially other investments. To the extent higher inflation could lead to currency fluctuation, we may also experience increased volatility on foreign exchange gains and losses in our consolidated financial statements.
Counterparty credit risk typically increases during periods of economic uncertainty, and we believe our exposure has increased in recent years. In connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances, we assume a substantial degree of credit risk associated with our brokers. In accordance with industry practice, we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers, who then forward these payments to the ceding insurers that have purchased reinsurance from us. Likewise, premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers, who then pass the amounts to us. Many of our contracts provide that if a broker fails to make a payment to a ceding insurer, we remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, when the ceding insurer pays premiums to brokers for payment to us,
these premiums are considered to have been received by us upon receipt by the broker and the ceding insurer is no longer liable to us for those amounts, even if we have not received the premiums.
We are also exposed to the credit risk of our customers, who, pursuant to their contracts with us, frequently pay us over time. We may not collect all our premiums receivable from our ceding insurers and reinsurers, and we may not collect all our reinsurance recoverable from our own retrocessionaires. We have significant premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverable, and our failure to collect even a small portion of these amounts, or a meaningful delay in the collection of recoverables as to which our own underlying obligations are due, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had immense impacts on a global scale, including on the insurance and reinsurance industries where it has raised many new questions and challenges for us and our industry. It is difficult to predict all of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets in which we participate and our ability to effectively respond to these changing market dynamics.
The pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty. To the extent these conditions continue and potentially worsen, particularly with subsequent waves of infection, they could have the following impacts on our business operations and current and future financial performance and could impact us in other ways that we cannot predict:
We have significant exposure to losses stemming from COVID-19 related claims, and we expect losses to emerge over time as the full impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic triggers coverage is dependent on specific policy language, terms and exclusions. In addition, legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences may impose new obligations on insurers in connection with the pandemic that extend coverage beyond the intended contractual obligations or lead to an increase in the frequency or severity of claims beyond expected levels, resulting in the emergence of unexpected or un-modeled insurance or reinsurance losses.
•An economic recession or slowdown in economic activity resulting from the pandemic will not only increase the probability of losses, but could also reduce the demand for insurance and reinsurance, which could reduce our premium volume.
•Ongoing disruption in global financial markets and economic uncertainty due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 could cause us to incur investment losses, including credit impairments in our fixed maturity portfolio, or decline in interest rates which may reduce our future net investment income. Responses to the pandemic, including by governments, may lead or contribute to continued high inflation.
•Our counterparty credit risk may also increase, as some of our counterparties may face increased financial difficulties due to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on the world economy and financial markets.
•From an operational perspective, our employees, directors and agents, as well as the workforces of our brokers, vendors, service providers, retrocessionaires and other counterparties, may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or efforts to mitigate the pandemic. Remote work arrangements affect our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity risks, and may adversely affect our ability to manage our business.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could also exacerbate the other risks we face described herein. All of the foregoing events or potential outcomes, including in combination with other risk factors included herein, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any period, and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
We routinely transact business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our financial reporting currency. Moreover, we maintain a portion of our cash and investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and certain of our subsidiaries have non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Although we generally seek to hedge significant non-U.S. dollar positions, we may experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these foreign currencies, which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease. In addition, failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile. Our significant third-party capital management operations may further complicate these foreign currency operational needs and risk.
Our exposure to significant catastrophic events may cause significant volatility in our operating and capital needs. To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. Any further equity, debt or hybrid financings, or capacity needed for letters of credit, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. We are also exposed to the risk that the contingent capital facilities we have in place may not be available as expected.
If we are unable to obtain adequate capital when needed, we may not be able to grow and take advantage of favorable market conditions, or we may be required to reduce the amount of business that we write, impacting our results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise new capital for our joint ventures, managed funds and other private alternative investment vehicles, which would reduce our future fee income and market capacity, and thus negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, it is possible that substantial losses ceded to the alternative capital sector over a period of years, and restraints on capital return and maintenance of collateral for prior loss periods by a number of market participants, may contribute to a reduction in investor appetite to this product class in the near term.","Accordingly, our financial results are subject to a variety of investment risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, inflation, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit and default risk.

Item 1A,Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters,"Our operating subsidiaries conduct business globally and are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in multiple jurisdictions. See “Part I, Item 1. Business—Regulation.” These statutes, regulations and policies may, among other things, restrict the ability of our subsidiaries, joint ventures or managed funds to write certain business, make certain investments and distribute funds. We may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, these statutes and regulations, which could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in these jurisdictions, which could subject us to fines and/or penalties. Our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation in the future. Any failure to comply with current or future applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in these jurisdictions, which could subject us to fines and other penalties. In addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which our operating subsidiaries are subject or in their interpretation could have an adverse effect on our business.
Several of our operating subsidiaries are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except Bermuda, conduct business only from their offices in Bermuda and do not maintain offices in the U.S. The insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe. If our Bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the U.S., jurisdictions in the EU, or elsewhere, we could face challenges to the future operations of these companies. We could also be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any such requirements could impact the operations of our insurance and/or non-insurance subsidiaries, result in increased costs for us and impact our financial condition
It is possible that individual jurisdiction or cross border regulatory developments could adversely differentiate Bermuda, the jurisdiction in which we are subject to group supervision, or could exclude Bermuda-based companies from benefits such as market access, mutual recognition or reciprocal rights made available to other jurisdictions, which could adversely impact us. Any such development could significantly and negatively affect our operations.
The insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the U.S. and individual state governments, as well as a number of international authorities, and we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future.
We could also be adversely affected by proposals or enacted legislation that provide for reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target, expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for perils such as hurricanes or earthquakes or for a pandemic disease outbreak, mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies, expand the scope of the Federal Insurance Office or establish a new federal insurance regulator or otherwise revise laws, regulations, or contracts under which we operate, which may disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of another.
Bermuda is also subject to increasing scrutiny by political bodies outside of Bermuda, including the EU Code of Conduct Group. See “The OECD and the EU may pursue measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income and increase our reporting requirements.” Due to this increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the reinsurance industry and Bermuda, our cost of compliance with applicable laws may increase, which could result in a decrease to our profitability. Further, as we continue to expand our business operations outside of Bermuda, we are increasingly subject to new and additional regulations, including, for example, laws relating to anti-corruption and anti-bribery.
We are incorporated in Bermuda and many of our operating companies are domiciled in Bermuda. Therefore, changes in Bermuda law and regulation may have an adverse impact on our operations, such as the imposition of tax liability, increased regulatory supervision or changes in regulation.
In addition, we are subject to changes in the political environment in Bermuda, which could make it difficult to operate in, or attract talent to, Bermuda. In addition, Bermuda, which is currently an overseas territory of the U.K., may consider changes to its relationship with the U.K. in the future. These changes could adversely affect Bermuda or the international reinsurance market focused there, either of which could adversely impact us commercially.
Many jurisdictions in the U.S. do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted, the form and quantity of which is also subject to the regulations of those jurisdictions. Our contracts generally require us to post such security via a letter of credit, a trust account, or where applicable utilize a multi-beneficiary reinsurance trust, with the release of such security being controlled by the insurance company and/or a regulator. Because of these requirements, we could be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to certain of our competitors who are licensed and admitted in U.S. jurisdictions. Further, if we are not able to access sufficient unrestricted liquid assets from our other operations in order to operate our business from time to time, our business could be adversely impacted. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Cash Flows—Credit Facilities, Trusts and Other Collateral Arrangements—Multi-Beneficiary Reinsurance Trusts and Multi-Beneficiary Reduced Collateral Reinsurance Trusts” for a discussion of certain of these collateral arrangements.
Accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles, both prospectively and for prior periods, and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Required modification of our existing principles, and new disclosure requirements, could have an impact on our results of operations and increase our expenses in order to implement and comply with any new requirements.
We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions. U.S. laws and regulations that may be applicable to us include economic trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by OFAC as well as certain laws administered by the U.S. Department of State. The sanctions laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate may differ to some degree from those of the U.S. and these differences may additionally expose us to sanctions violations.
In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit corrupt payments or improper gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials. It is possible that an employee or intermediary could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other punitive actions. In addition, such violations could damage our business and our reputation. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our business and reputation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.","Business—Regulation.” These statutes, regulations and policies may, among other things, restrict the ability of our subsidiaries, joint ventures or managed funds to write certain business, make certain investments and distribute funds.

Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our business and reputation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."
Item 1A,Risks Related to Taxation,"We conduct a significant amount of business through Bermuda subsidiaries that we believe are not subject to U.S. corporate income tax as they are not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. Since there is considerable uncertainty, however, as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S., we cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that any of our non-U.S. companies is engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. Were this to occur, such company could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business. If we or one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries were ultimately held to be subject to taxation, our earnings would correspondingly decline.
While we have maintained our rigorous tax-related operating protocols during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that ongoing severe travel restrictions may give rise to substantial operating challenges should current conditions persist.
In 2017, the U.S. adopted tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a new base erosion anti-avoidance tax that would have substantially altered the taxation of affiliate reinsurance between our operating affiliates which are subject to U.S. taxation and our non-U.S. affiliates which are not. Although base erosion anti-avoidance tax has not significantly impacted us to date as the affiliate reinsurance targeted by the base erosion anti-avoidance tax was not material to our operations, it could limit our ability to execute affiliate reinsurance transactions that would otherwise be undertaken for non-tax business reasons, such as efficient use of capital within our group, in the future and could result in higher prices for the reinsurance products we buy and sell.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the likelihood that we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any entity managed by us will be deemed a “controlled foreign corporation” within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code for U.S. federal tax purposes. Specifically, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expands the definition of “U.S. shareholder” for “controlled foreign corporation” purposes to include “U.S. persons” who own 10% or more of the value of a foreign corporation’s shares, rather than only looking to voting power held. In the event a corporation is characterized as a “controlled foreign corporation,” any “U.S. shareholder” of the “controlled foreign corporation” is required to include its pro rata share of certain insurance and related investment income in income for a taxable year, even if such income is not distributed.
In addition to changes in the “controlled foreign corporation” rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains modifications to certain provisions relating to PFIC status that could, for example, discourage U.S. persons from investing in our joint ventures or other entities we manage. While we believe that we should not be characterized as a PFIC, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in future years. It is also possible that joint venture entities managed by us may be characterized as PFICs, which could make these entities less attractive to investors and reduce our fee income.
It is currently anticipated (though not assured) that we will operate each of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in such a way that gross related person insurance income will constitute less the 20% of the gross insurance income of each of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries for any taxable year in the foreseeable future. On January 25, 2022, proposed regulations were published which could, if finalized in their current form, substantially expand the definition of related person insurance income to include insurance income of our non-U.S. subsidiaries related to affiliate reinsurance transactions. These regulations would apply to taxable years beginning after the date the regulations are finalized. Although we cannot predict whether, when or in what form the proposed regulations might be finalized, the proposed regulations, if finalized in their current form, could limit our ability to execute affiliate reinsurance transactions that would otherwise be undertaken for non-tax business reasons in the future and could increase the risk that gross related person insurance income could constitute 20% or more of the gross insurance income of one or more of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries in a particular taxable year, which could result in such related person insurance income being taxable to U.S. persons that own our shares.
Further, the taxation of us or our subsidiaries and our shareholders may be the subject of future tax legislation, which could have a material adverse effect on us or our shareholders.
The OECD has published reports and launched a global dialog among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of jurisdictions perceived by the OECD to be tax havens or offering preferential tax regimes. In 2017, the EU initiated similar measures and identified certain jurisdictions, including Bermuda, which it considered had tax systems that facilitated offshore structuring by attracting profits without commensurate economic activity. The EU did temporarily add Bermuda to its “blacklist” of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes between March 2019 and May 2019, when Bermuda adopted economic substance legislation that the EU deemed compliant with its requirements.
In addition, in 2015, the OECD published its final series of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reports related to its attempt to coordinate multilateral action on international tax rules. The actions recommended changes in the tax law which, if adopted, could subject us to additional taxes and increase the complexity and cost of tax compliance.
Following the recommendations in the final series of these reports, the OECD has continued to consult on and review the tax challenges arising from the digital economy. In May 2019, the OECD published a “Programme of Work,” divided into two pillars, with the goal of tackling the challenges of taxing the digital economy. The OECD then published Blueprints for the two pillars late in 2020 and commenced a public consultation on the proposals.
In 2021, significant steps were taken to develop a plan for implementing a two-pillar solution. In October, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework released a statement agreeing a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digital economy. Pillar One addresses the broader challenge of a digitalized economy and focuses on the allocation of group profits among taxing jurisdictions based on a market-based concept rather than historical “permanent establishment” concepts. Pillar One includes explicit exclusions for Regulated Financial Services, so is not expected to have a material impact on insurance and reinsurance groups. Pillar Two addresses the remaining Base Erosion and Profit Shifting risk of profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions by introducing a global minimum tax on large groups (groups with consolidated revenues in excess of €750 million), which would require large groups to calculate the effective tax rate of each group company operating in a relevant jurisdiction and, where a group company has an effective tax rate below 15%, pay an additional top-up tax. In December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules for domestic implementation of the global minimum tax and shortly thereafter the European Commission proposed a Directive to implement the Pillar Two rules into EU law, which, if unanimously agreed by EU member states, will require EU member states to transpose the rules into their national laws by 31 December 2022 with certain measures initially coming into effect from 1 January 2023. If the countries in which we operate amend their tax laws to fully adopt the Pillar Two framework, there may be an increase in the company’s income taxes.
Further, we could be adversely impacted by other changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by taxation authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.","Since there is considerable uncertainty, however, as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the U.S., we cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that any of our non-U.S. companies is engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. Were this to occur, such company could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business.

Pillar Two addresses the remaining Base Erosion and Profit Shifting risk of profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions by introducing a global minimum tax on large groups (groups with consolidated revenues in excess of €750 million), which would require large groups to calculate the effective tax rate of each group company operating in a relevant jurisdiction and, where a group company has an effective tax rate below 15%, pay an additional top-up tax. In December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules for domestic implementation of the global minimum tax and shortly thereafter the European Commission proposed a Directive to implement the Pillar Two rules into EU law, which, if unanimously agreed by EU member states, will require EU member states to transpose the rules into their national laws by 31 December 2022 with certain measures initially coming into effect from 1 January 2023. If the countries in which we operate amend their tax laws to fully adopt the Pillar Two framework, there may be an increase in the company’s income taxes."
Item 1A,Risks Related to the Ownership of our Securities,"As a holding company with no direct operations, we rely on our investment income, cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders. From time to time, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to meet these obligations. Regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends under Bermuda law, Swiss law and various U.S. laws regulate the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us, we may be unable to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repay our indebtedness.
Some provisions of our bye-laws may discourage third parties from making unsolicited takeover bids or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. In particular, our bye-laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute 9.9% or more of any class or series of our shares, unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the Board. In addition, our bye-laws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning, directly or indirectly, beneficially or otherwise, more than 9.9% of our common shares to not more than 9.9% of the total voting power of our shares unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the Board. These provisions may have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of our common shares or proposals to acquire us, even if our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests.
In addition, our bye-laws provide for, among other things:
•a classified Board, whose size is generally fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a 66 2/3% vote;
•restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors, submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings;
•a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the Board without further shareholder action; and
•a 66 2/3% shareholder vote to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the bye-laws.
These bye-law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy contest or otherwise and could discourage a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, these bye-law provisions could prevent the removal of our current Board of Directors and management. To the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares.
In addition, many jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Where such laws apply to us and our subsidiaries, there can be no effective change in our control unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement with the regulators and has obtained prior approval for the proposed change from such regulators. Under these laws, control is typically presumed when a person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable. Therefore, a person may not acquire 10% or more of our common shares without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulators.
Investors may have difficulty in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the U.S.
We are a Bermuda company. In addition, many of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the U.S. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors may be located outside the U.S. Investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the U.S. on our directors and officers who reside outside the U.S. or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the U.S. to receive service of process.","Regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends under Bermuda law, Swiss law and various U.S. laws regulate the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us, we may be unable to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repay our indebtedness. Some provisions of our bye-laws may discourage third parties from making unsolicited takeover bids or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. In particular, our bye-laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute 9.9% or more of any class or series of our shares, unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the Board. To the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares. Under these laws, control is typically presumed when a person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable. Therefore, a person may not acquire 10% or more of our common shares without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulators."
Item 7A,QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK,"The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from sensitivities presented are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, derivatives and product offerings. The results of analysis used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events or losses. Refer to “Note On Forward-Looking Statements” for additional discussion regarding forward-looking statements included herein.
We are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk; foreign currency risk; credit risk; and equity price risk. Our policies to address these risks in 2021 were not materially different than those used in 2020.
The ongoing and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a longer or more severe recession, which may increase the probability of credit losses in our investment portfolio. Volatility in global financial markets, together with low or negative interest rates, reduced liquidity and a slowdown in global economic conditions may adversely affect our investment portfolio. Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, including with respect to reinsurance brokers, customers and retrocessionaires, which may materially increase to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic affects our ability to collect premiums receivable or reinsurance recoverable.
Our investment guidelines permit, subject to approval, investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, foreign currency forward contracts and swap agreements, which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes. Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to derivatives we have entered into.","The results of analysis used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events or losses.

Our investment guidelines permit, subject to approval, investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, foreign currency forward contracts and swap agreements, which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes."
Item 7A,Foreign Currency Risk,"Our functional currency for consolidated reporting purposes is the U.S. dollar. We routinely write a portion of our business in currencies other than U.S. dollars and invest a portion of our cash and investment portfolio in those currencies. In addition, certain of our entities have non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. As a result, we may experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our consolidated financial statements. We are primarily impacted by the foreign currency risk exposures noted below, and may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to foreign currency forward and option contracts we have entered into.
Our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts for notional values that approximate the foreign currency liabilities, including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable, net of any cash, investments and receivables held in the respective foreign currency. Our use of foreign currency forward and option contracts is intended to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations. We may determine not to match a portion of our projected underwriting related assets or liabilities with underlying foreign currency exposure with investments in the same currencies, which would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and potentially increase the impact and volatility of foreign exchange gains and losses on our results of operations.
Our investment portfolio is exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed maturity investments, short term investments and other investments. To economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts. In certain instances, we may assume foreign exchange risk as part of our investment strategy. Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non-U.S. dollar fixed maturity investments trading and other investments, and foreign exchange gains or losses associated with our hedging of these non-U.S. dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange (losses) gains in our consolidated statements of operations. In the future, we may choose to increase our exposure to non-U.S. dollar investments.","In addition, certain of our entities have non-U.S. dollar functional currencies.

Item 7A,Credit Risk,"Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to make timely payments in accordance with contractual terms of the instrument or contract and market risk associated with changes in credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to direct credit risk within our portfolios of fixed maturity and short term investments, and through customers and reinsurers in the form of premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverable, respectively, as discussed below. 
Credit risk related to our fixed maturity investments and short term investments, as well as our private credit funds and term loans which primarily invest in debt instruments, is the exposure to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of individual investment holdings, issuers, groups of issuers, industries and countries. We manage credit risk in our fixed maturity investments and short term investments through credit research performed primarily by our investment management service providers and our evaluation of these investment managers adherence to investment mandates provided to them. The management of credit risk in the investment portfolio is integrated in our credit risk governance framework and the management of credit exposures and concentrations within the investment portfolio are carried out in accordance with our risk policies, limits and risk concentrations as overseen by the Investment and Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. In the investment portfolio, we review on a regular basis our asset concentration, credit quality and adherence to credit limit guidelines. In addition, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and, except for the securities of the U.S. Government and U.S. Government related entities, and money market securities, none of our fixed-maturity and short-term investments exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021.
We also employ credit derivatives in our investment portfolio to either assume credit risk or hedge our credit exposure. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding credit derivatives of $Nil in notional positions to hedge credit risk and $218.5 million in notional positions to assume credit risk, denominated in U.S. dollars (2020 - $Nil and $96.8 million, respectively). Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to credit derivatives entered into by us. The aggregate hypothetical market value impact from an immediate upward shift in credit spreads of 100 basis points would cause a decrease in the market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately $9.1 million at December 31, 2021. Conversely, the aggregate hypothetical market value impact from an immediate downward shift in credit spreads of 100 basis points would cause an increase in the market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately $9.1 million at December 31, 2021. For an immediate downward shift in credit spreads, we do not allow credit spreads to go negative in calculating the impact. The foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time horizon, since this presents the worst-case scenario. 
Premiums receivable from ceding companies and reinsurance recoverable from our reinsurers are subject to credit risk. To mitigate credit risk related to reinsurance premiums receivable, we have established standards for ceding companies and, in most cases, have a contractual right of offset allowing us to settle claims net of any reinsurance premiums receivable. To mitigate credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverable amounts, we consider the financial strength of our reinsurers when determining whether to purchase coverage from them. We generally obtain reinsurance coverage from companies rated “A-“ or better by S&P unless the obligations are collateralized. We routinely monitor the financial performance and rating status of all material reinsurers. Refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Reinsurance Recoverable” for additional information with respect to reinsurance recoverable.","We are primarily exposed to direct credit risk within our portfolios of fixed maturity and short term investments, and through customers and reinsurers in the form of premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverable, respectively, as discussed below.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Reinsurance Recoverable” for additional information with respect to reinsurance recoverable."
Item 7,Cash Flows 2021,"During 2021, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $122.2 million, to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020.
Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 were $1.2 billion, compared to $2.0 billion during 2020. Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 were primarily the result of certain adjustments to reconcile our net loss of $103.4 million to net cash provided by operating activities, including:
•an increase in reserve for claims and claim expenses of $2.9 billion primarily resulting from net claims and claim expenses associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses;
•an increase in unearned premiums of $767.6 million due to the growth in gross premiums written across both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments;
•an increase in reinsurance balances payable of $372.6 million principally driven by the issuance of non-voting preference shares to investors in Upsilon RFO, which are accounted for as prospective reinsurance and included in reinsurance balances payable on our consolidated balance sheet. See “Note 11. Variable Interest Entities” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to Upsilon RFO’s non-voting preference shares; partially offset by
•an increase in reinsurance recoverable of $1.3 billion due to the increase in net claims and claim expenses and recoverables associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses;
•an increase in premiums receivable of $886.9 million due to the timing of receipts and increase in our gross premiums written;
•an increase of $215.6 million in our deferred acquisition costs due to the growth in gross premiums written across both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments;
•an increase of $31.1 million in our prepaid reinsurance premiums due to an increase in ceded premiums written; and
•a decrease in other operating cash flows of $437.2 million primarily reflecting subscriptions received in advance of the issuance of Upsilon RFO’s non-voting preference shares effective January 1, 2021, which were recorded in other liabilities at December 31, 2020. During 2021, in connection with the issuance of the non-voting preference shares of Upsilon RFO, other liabilities were reduced by the subscriptions received in advance, and reinsurance balances payable were increased by an offsetting amount, with corresponding impacts to other operating cash flows and the change in reinsurance balances payable, as noted above, on our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2021. See “Note 11. Variable Interest Entities” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to Upsilon RFO’s non-voting preference shares.
Cash flows used in investing activities. During 2021, our cash flows used in investing activities were $816.3 million, principally reflecting net purchases of other investments of $617.8 million, short term investments of $252.8 million and fixed maturity investments trading of $136.8 million, partially offset by cash flow from net
sales of and equity investments trading of $206.6 million. The net purchases of other investments, was primarily driven by an increased allocation to catastrophe bonds and fund investments, whereas the net purchases of short term investments and fixed maturity investments trading was primarily funded by cash flows provided by operating activities, as described above.
Cash flows used in financing activities. Our cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 were $302.5 million, and were principally the result of:
•the repurchase of 6.6 million of our common shares in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $1.0 billion and an average price of $156.78 per common share;
•the redemption of all 11 million of our outstanding 5.375% Series E Preference Shares on August 11, 2021 for $275.0 million;
•dividends paid on our common and preference shares of $67.8 million and $32.9 million, respectively; and partially offset by
•net inflows of $488.7 million associated with the issuance of 20 million of Depositary Shares (each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of our 4.20% Series G Preference Shares), net of expenses;
•net inflows of $594.3 million primarily related to net third-party redeemable noncontrolling interest share transactions in DaVinci, Medici and Vermeer; and
•net inflows of $30.0 million from the drawdown of the Medici Revolving Credit Facility. See “Note 9.

During 2020, our cash flows used in investing activities were $2.3 billion, principally reflecting net purchases of fixed maturity investments trading, short term investments and other investments of $1.6 billion, $581.5 million, and $216.8 million, respectively. The net purchase of fixed maturity investments trading was primarily funded by cash flows provided by operating activities, as described above, and the issuance of RenaissanceRe common shares during the second quarter of 2020, whereas the net purchase of short term investments was primarily associated with capital received from investors in Upsilon RFO during 2020.The net purchase of other investments during 2020 was primarily driven by an increased allocation to catastrophe bonds.

Item 7,Capital Resources,"We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and seek to adjust our capital according to the needs of our business. In particular, we require capital sufficient to meet or exceed the capital adequacy ratios established by rating agencies for maintenance of appropriate financial strength ratings, the capital adequacy tests performed by regulatory authorities and the capital requirements under our credit facilities. From time to time, rating agencies may make changes in their capital models and rating methodologies, which could increase the amount of capital required to support our ratings. We may seek to raise additional capital or return capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and cash dividends (or a combination of such methods). In the normal course of our operations, we may from time to time evaluate additional share or debt issuances given prevailing market conditions and capital management strategies, including for our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds. In addition, as noted above, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to obtain letter of credit facilities for the benefit of our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint ventures and managed funds in their reinsurance and insurance business.
(1)RenaissanceRe owns a noncontrolling economic interest in its joint venture DaVinciRe. Because RenaissanceRe controls a majority of DaVinciRe’s outstanding voting rights, the consolidated financial statements of DaVinciRe are included in the consolidated financial statements of RenaissanceRe. However, RenaissanceRe does not guarantee or provide credit support for DaVinciRe and RenaissanceRe’s financial exposure to DaVinciRe is limited to its investment in DaVinciRe’s shares and counterparty credit risk arising from reinsurance transactions.
(2)RenaissanceRe owns a noncontrolling economic interest in Medici. Because RenaissanceRe controls all of Medici’s outstanding voting rights, the financial statements of Medici are included in RenaissanceRe’s consolidated financial statements.
Our shareholders’ equity attributable to RenaissanceRe decreased $0.9 billion during 2021 principally as a result of:

We may seek to raise additional capital or return capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and cash dividends (or a combination of such methods). In addition, as noted above, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to obtain letter of credit facilities for the benefit of our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint ventures and managed funds in their reinsurance and insurance business.

Item 7,Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses,"We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. Our actual net claims and claim expenses paid will differ, perhaps materially, from the estimates reflected in our financial statements, which may adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and capital resources.
Refer to “Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year development of the reserve for claims and claim expenses, analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” for more information on the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves, and sensitivity analysis for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments.","We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves.

Item 7,Investments,"We structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet our claims obligations, to be well diversified across market sectors, and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. For additional information regarding our investments and the fair value measurement of our investments refer to “Note 5. Investments” and “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”
As the reinsurance coverages we sell include substantial protection for damages resulting from natural and man-made catastrophes, as well as for potentially large casualty and specialty exposures, we expect from time to time to become liable for substantial claim payments on short notice. Accordingly, our investment portfolio as a whole is structured to seek to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity, which means that the large majority of our investments are highly rated fixed income securities, including U.S. treasuries, agencies, highly rated sovereign and supranational securities, high-grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We also have an allocation to publicly traded equities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as equity investments trading and an allocation to other investments (including catastrophe bonds, direct private equity investments, fund investments and term loans).","Notwithstanding the foregoing, our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities.

Item 7,Fixed Maturity Investments and Short Term Investments,"At December 31, 2021, our fixed maturity investments and short term investment portfolio had a weighted average credit quality rating of AA (2020 – AAA) and a weighted average effective yield of 1.2% (2020 – 0.9%). At December 31, 2021, our non-investment grade and not rated fixed maturity investments totaled $1.3 billion or 9.7% of our fixed maturity investments (2020 - $1.4 billion or 10.0%, respectively). In addition, within our other investments category we have funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and non-investment grade cat-linked securities. At December 31, 2021, the funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and non-investment grade cat-linked securities totaled $1.8 billion (2020 – $911.4 million).
At December 31, 2021, we had $5.3 billion of short term investments (2020 – $5.0 billion). Short term investments are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased. Short term investments are carried at fair value. The increase in our allocation to short term investments at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, is principally driven by the additional invested assets in certain of our managed joint ventures and managed funds that limit investment allocation to shorter term securities.
The duration of our fixed maturity investments and short term investments at December 31, 2021 was 3.0 years (2020 - 2.9 years). From time to time, we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions.
The value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in economic conditions or the investment markets. Additionally, our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our investments.","In addition, within our other investments category we have funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and non-investment grade cat-linked securities.

Item 7,Equity Investments Trading,"A portion of our investments included in equity investments trading is managed pursuant to diversified public equity securities mandates with third-party investment managers. In addition, our equity investments trading include more concentrated public equity positions that we invest in through our strategic investment portfolio. These investments are subject to a variety of risks including: company performance, the availability of strategic investment opportunities, and macro-economic, industry, and systemic risks of the equity markets overall. Consequently, the carrying value of our investment portfolio will vary over time as the value or size of our portfolio of strategic investments in marketable equity securities fluctuates. The change in fair value of equity investments trading from 2020 to 2021 was impacted by the partial sale of our strategic investment in Trupanion. It is possible we will increase our equity allocation in the future, and it could, from time to time, have a material effect on our financial results.","Consequently, the carrying value of our investment portfolio will vary over time as the value or size of our portfolio of strategic investments in marketable equity securities fluctuates. It is possible we will increase our equity allocation in the future, and it could, from time to time, have a material effect on our financial results."
Item 7,Other Investments,"We account for our other investments at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic Financial Instruments. The fair value of our fund investments, which include private equity funds, private credit funds and hedge funds, is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in other investments, and is generally established on the basis of the net asset value per share (or its equivalent), determined by the managers of these investments in accordance with the applicable governing documents. Many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term.
Some of our fund managers and fund administrators are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date. We typically experience a reporting lag to receive a final net asset value report of one month for our hedge funds and certain private credit funds and three months for private equity funds and private credit funds, although we have occasionally experienced delays of up to six months at year end. In circumstances where there is a reporting lag, we estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month or quarter-end fund valuation, adjusting for actual capital calls, redemptions or distributions, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and then estimating the return for the current period using all information available to us. This principally includes using preliminary estimates reported to us by our fund managers, estimating returns based on the performance of broad market indices, or other valuation methods. Actual final fund valuations may differ, perhaps materially, from our estimates and these differences are recorded as a change in estimate in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which they are reported to us. Included in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments for 2021 is income of $7.0 million (2020 - a loss of $2.4 million) representing the change in estimate during the period related to the difference between our estimated net realized and unrealized gains (losses) due to the lag in reporting discussed above and the actual amount as reported in the final net asset values provided by our fund managers.
Our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds is based on quoted market prices or, when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. Refer to “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding the fair value measurement of our investments.
We have committed capital to direct equity investments, fund investments, term loans, and investments in other ventures of $2.7 billion, of which $1.3 billion has been contributed at December 31, 2021. Our remaining commitments to these investments at December 31, 2021 totaled $1.4 billion. In the future, we may enter into additional commitments in respect of these investments or individual portfolio company investment opportunities.","We account for our other investments at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic Financial Instruments.

Item 7,Ratings,"Financial strength ratings are important to the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies. We have received high long-term issuer credit and financial strength ratings and scores from A.M. Best, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, as applicable. These ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations, and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures and ratings may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them. Additionally, rating organizations may change their rating methodology, which could have a material impact on our financial strength ratings.
The ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures and the ERM score of RenaissanceRe as of February 2, 2022 are presented below.
(1)    The A.M. Best ratings for our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures represent the insurer’s financial strength rating. The Lloyd’s Overall Market Rating represents RenaissanceRe Syndicate 1458’s financial strength rating. RenaissanceRe has been assigned a “Very Strong” ERM score by A.M. Best.
(2)    The S&P ratings for our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures represent the insurer’s financial strength rating and the issuer’s long-term issuer credit rating. The Lloyd’s Overall Market Rating represents RenaissanceRe Syndicate 1458’s financial strength rating. RenaissanceRe has been assigned a “Very Strong” ERM score by S&P.
(3)    The Moody’s ratings represent the insurer’s financial strength rating.
(4)    The Fitch rating for Renaissance Reinsurance represents the insurer’s financial strength rating. The Lloyd’s Overall Market Rating represents Syndicate 1458’s financial strength rating.
The outlook for all of our A.M. Best ratings is stable. “A+” is the second highest designation of A.M. Best’s rating levels. “A+” rated insurance companies are defined as “Superior” companies and are considered by A.M. Best to have a very strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. “A” is the third highest designation assigned by A.M. Best, representing A.M. Best’s opinion that the insurer has an “Excellent” ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders.
The outlook for all of our S&P ratings is stable. The “A” range (“A+,” “A,” “A-”), which is the third highest rating assigned by S&P, indicates that S&P believes the insurers have strong capacity to meet their respective financial commitments but they are somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects or changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers rated higher.
The outlook for all of our Moody’s ratings is stable. Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Ratings represent its opinions of the ability of insurance companies to pay punctually policyholder claims and obligations and senior unsecured debt instruments. Moody’s believes that insurance companies rated “A1” and “A3” offer good financial security.
The outlook for all of our Fitch ratings is stable. Fitch believes that insurance companies rated “A+” have “Strong” capacity to meet policyholders and contract obligations on a timely basis with a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. Insurers rated “AA-""”by Fitch are believed to have a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments and very strong capital to meet policyholder obligations.
A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch have each assigned a financial strength rating to the Lloyd’s overall market. The financial risks to policy holders of syndicates within the Lloyd’s market are partially mutualized through the Lloyd’s Central Fund, to which all underwriting members contribute. Because of the presence of the Lloyd’s Central Fund, and the current legal and regulatory structure of the Lloyd’s market, financial strength ratings on individual syndicates would not be particularly meaningful and in any event would not be lower than the financial strength rating of the Lloyd’s overall market.

Item 7,SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION,"RenaissanceRe Finance, a 100% owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe, is the issuer of certain 3.700% Senior Notes due 2025 and 3.450% Senior Notes due 2027, each of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RenaissanceRe. The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of RenaissanceRe and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of RenaissanceRe which may be outstanding from time to time.

Item 7,Reinsurance Market Trends and Developments,"We have built a global, multi-line, specialist company that allows us to write more business with more customers in more locations around the world. In 2021, we continued our growth with existing and new customers across our segments and broadened our access to risk, writing more lines of business on more
platforms. We also continued to diversify our sources of capital through various owned and managed balance sheets as well as the equity, debt and insurance-linked securities markets. This has afforded us significant flexibility to react when the world changes. We believe that the trusted relationships we have developed have provided us an incumbency position, contributing to our significant growth in attractive business in 2021. Despite our recent growth, we reduced our growth rate at the recent January 1st renewals, electing to focus more on optimizing our portfolio and increasing its efficiency and profitability. As always, we were a consistent partner, offering capacity across the risk spectrum.","We have built a global, multi-line, specialist company that allows us to write more business with more customers in more locations around the world.

Item 7,Recent Industry Trends,"In 2021, the insurance industry experienced its fifth consecutive year of elevated catastrophe losses. We saw a market trend shift away from property catastrophe risk due to the effects of climate change, social and monetary inflation, as well as a lack of confidence in catastrophe modeling. Despite these challenges, we believe that our expertise and experience allow us to determine that we are being paid adequately to assume risk, which we are uniquely positioned to understand due to our strong underwriting bench (which has been through multiple market cycles), as well as our integrated system, and our team of scientists, engineers, and risk modelers at RenaissanceRe Sciences. We believe that market conditions have created significant opportunities to source attractive risk in the lines of business that we write, and that such opportunities will result in superior returns for our shareholders.
Social inflation continues to be a risk, and we expect it to be an ongoing trend. Over the course of 2021, we also saw the rapid increase of monetary inflation. This is particularly impactful to our industry, as it drives rebuilding costs, such as increases in wages and commodity prices. We consider the anticipated effects of inflation on us in our catastrophe loss models and on our investment portfolio.
In the current market, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to write a variety of risks, leveraging the enhancements we made over the last several years to our risk and capital management technology and underwriting expertise to cover additional lines of business. In particular, we have invested heavily to understand the influence of climate change on the weather and its impact on the risks that we take. We plan to continue to seek to take advantage of additional opportunities throughout the year and believe that strategic decisions that we have made in prior periods have laid the foundation for these initiatives. We believe that our clients value our ability to be a long-term partner that brings access to multiple forms of capital and innovative, large-scale solutions.","We saw a market trend shift away from property catastrophe risk due to the effects of climate change, social and monetary inflation, as well as a lack of confidence in catastrophe modeling.

Item 7,January 1st Renewals,"Property. The January 1 renewal is the largest renewal period for our Property segment. We had several goals we wanted to achieve, including seeking rate increases, improving terms and conditions, adjusting for our increased view of risk, and decreasing our exposure to aggregate deals; and we were pleased with the results and the portfolio we built. We believe that we saw improved market conditions, and across markets we pushed hard for higher rates, while remaining disciplined when rate increases were not sufficient. We used the options we have developed, such as our third-party capital vehicles, to provide flexibility and to optimize our gross-to-net strategy, as evidenced by the growth in DaVinci and the increased percentage of property catastrophe business that we allocated to it. A significant amount of the growth in our Property segment over the last few years has been in the other property class of business, due largely to the substantial rate increases in the U.S. property excess and surplus market. As we expected, there was significant dislocation in the property retrocession markets at January 1, and we expect these trends to continue in 2022.
Casualty and Specialty. The January 1 renewal is also important for our Casualty and Specialty segment. Casualty and Specialty business has become increasingly desirable due to a combination of robust multi-year rate increases, as well as recent favorable plan performance. We continued to see underlying rate increases across multiple lines of business and geographies within our Casualty and Specialty segment, and we expanded participation on multiple casualty and specialty lines. We believe that our book of business is continuing to reflect the rate improvements that we have seen over the past several years. We think that our prior work building strong relationships with key customers allowed us to gain superior access to desirable business.","We had several goals we wanted to achieve, including seeking rate increases, improving terms and conditions, adjusting for our increased view of risk, and decreasing our exposure to aggregate deals; and we were pleased with the results and the portfolio we built.

Item 7,General Economic Conditions,"We actively managed our capital in 2021 and expect to continue to do so in 2022. We believe that our shares have been trading at attractive levels, which provides us with additional options to manage excess capital. If this trend continues, we expect to utilize our strong capital position to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. When possible, our preference is to deploy any excess capital into profitable business opportunities before returning excess capital to shareholders.
Overall, 2021 was a challenging year for third-party capital, but our ability to raise funds is a testament to the deep experience of our Capital Partners team and the relationships that they have built over the 20 years in this area.
We believe the stresses in the global economy will continue and that these conditions may result in increased market volatility. A period of low interest rates may affect our ability to derive investment income from our investments. As interest rates begin to rise from historic lows, we expect that we will see an increase in net investment income from our investment portfolio. The effects of these interest rate trends on our reinsurance and insurance business could be magnified for longer-tail business lines that are more inflation sensitive, particularly in our Casualty and Specialty segment, and in our other property class of business within our Property segment. Notwithstanding the many uncertainties and challenges that lie ahead, we believe that our track record of responding to industry events, differentiated risk management and client-service capabilities, and access to diverse sources of both capital and risk position us favorably in the current environment.
We continue to closely monitor recent tax reform proposals and announcements. Tax law changes globally, and in the jurisdictions where we operate, could increase tax burdens on companies operating in such jurisdictions, or operating multilaterally, or which transact in or with respect to such jurisdictions. At this time, the practical details of how the OECD’s framework for instituting a global minimum corporate tax would be implemented are not clear, so we cannot anticipate or estimate the cost to us of this or any other such future initiative. However, we believe that the flexible global operating model that we have utilized will continue to prove resilient.","We actively managed our capital in 2021 and expect to continue to do so in 2022. If this trend continues, we expect to utilize our strong capital position to continue to return excess capital to shareholders.

Item 7,COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had immense impacts on a global scale, including on the (re)insurance industries where it has raised many new questions and challenges for us and our industry. While we believe that we can continue to execute on our strategic plan and compete for, and meet, the demand for the protection that we provide, it is difficult to predict all of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets in which we participate and our ability to effectively respond to these changing market dynamics.
See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,” for additional information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had immense impacts on a global scale, including on the (re)insurance industries where it has raised many new questions and challenges for us and our industry.

Item 7,Impairments,"The amount and timing of asset impairment is subject to significant estimation techniques and is a critical accounting estimate for us. The significant impairment reviews we complete are for our goodwill and other intangible assets and equity method investments, as described in more detail below.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, subject to impairment, and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, subject to impairment. If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. We recognized identifiable finite lived intangible assets of $11.2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average period of 10.5 years, identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets of $6.8 million, and certain other adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and shareholders’ equity of TMR at March 22, 2019, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019.
In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). Goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets.
We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For purposes of the annual impairment evaluation, we assess qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances exist that would lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we do not perform a quantitative evaluation. Should we determine that a quantitative analysis is required, we will first determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that with the carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then proceed to determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, we identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to, and review historical and forecasted operating and financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions. Other assumptions used could produce significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and a related charge in our consolidated statements of operations. An impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable. In the event we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, an accounting charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.
As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined that there was no impairment during 2021, and therefore the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information with respect to the impairment.
As at December 31, 2021, excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures, under the equity method, as noted below, our consolidated balance sheets include $210.9 million of goodwill (2020 - $211.0 million) and $32.6 million of other intangible assets (2020 - $38.6 million). Impairment charges related to these balances were $Nil during the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020 - $6.8 million, 2019 - $Nil). In the future, it is possible we will hold more goodwill and intangible assets, which would increase the degree of judgment and uncertainty embedded in our financial statements, and potentially increase the volatility of our reported results.","The significant impairment reviews we complete are for our goodwill and other intangible assets and equity method investments, as described in more detail below. Subsequent to initial recognition, finite lived other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, subject to impairment, and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, subject to impairment. If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, they are written down to their estimated fair values with a corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values. In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). For purposes of the annual impairment evaluation, we assess qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances exist that would lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company determined that there was no impairment during 2021, and therefore the Company recorded no intangible asset impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2021. As at December 31, 2021, excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures, under the equity method, as noted below, our consolidated balance sheets include $210.9 million of goodwill (2020 - $211.0 million) and $32.6 million of other intangible assets (2020 - $38.6 million). In the future, it is possible we will hold more goodwill and intangible assets, which would increase the degree of judgment and uncertainty embedded in our financial statements, and potentially increase the volatility of our reported results."
Item 7,"Investments in Other Ventures, Under Equity Method","Investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures, under equity method, and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in our results for the period. Any decline in the value of investments in other ventures, under equity method, including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee, considered by management to be other-than-temporary, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined. As of December 31, 2021, we had $98.1 million (2020 - $98.4 million) in investments in other ventures, under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets, including $9.9 million of goodwill and $8.7 million of other intangible assets (2020 - $10.6 million and $12.4 million). The carrying value of our investments in other ventures, under equity method, individually or in the aggregate, may, and likely will, differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so.
In determining whether an equity method investment is impaired, we take into consideration a variety of factors including the operating and financial performance of the investee, the investee’s future business plans and projections, recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies where available, discussions with the investee’s management, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value. Accordingly, we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change, this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these investments. This would cause us to write-down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the impairment charge is taken. We do not have any current plans to dispose of these investments, and cannot assure you we will consummate future transactions in which we realize the value at which these holdings are reflected in our financial statements. We have not recorded any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our investments in other ventures, under the equity method in any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. See “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.","Any decline in the value of investments in other ventures, under equity method, including goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee, considered by management to be other-than-temporary, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined.

Results of Operations for 2021 Compared to 2020","Net loss attributable to RenaissanceRe common shareholders was $73.4 million in 2021, compared to net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $731.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $804.9 million. As a result of our net loss attributable to RenaissanceRe common shareholders in 2021, we generated an annualized return on average common equity of negative 1.1% and our book value per common share decreased from $138.46 at December 31, 2020 to $132.17 at December 31, 2021, a 3.5% decrease, after considering the change in accumulated dividends paid to our common shareholders.
The most significant items affecting our financial performance during 2021, on a comparative basis to 2020, include:
•Impact of Weather-Related Large Losses and COVID-19 - in 2021, we had a net negative impact on our net loss attributable to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $962.1 million resulting from the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses. This compares to a net negative impact on our net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $493.6 million in 2020 resulting from the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and $286.6 million resulting from losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•Underwriting Results - we incurred an underwriting loss of $108.9 million and had a combined ratio of 102.1% in 2021, compared to an underwriting loss of $76.5 million and a combined ratio of 101.9% in 2020. Our underwriting loss in 2021 was comprised of an underwriting loss of $185.5 million in our Property segment, partially offset by underwriting income of $76.6 million in our Casualty and Specialty segment. In comparison, our underwriting loss in 2020 was comprised of $87.5 million of underwriting loss in our Casualty and Specialty segment, partially offset by underwriting income of $11.0 million in our Property segment.
Included in our underwriting results in 2021 was the impact of the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on our underwriting result of $1.4 billion and added 28.5 percentage points to the combined ratio, primarily in the Property segment. In comparison, our underwriting result in 2020 was principally impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and the COVID-19 losses. In 2020, the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $668.5 million and added 17.2 percentage points to the combined ratio, primarily in the Property segment. The COVID-19 losses incurred in 2020, which impacted both the Property and Casualty and Specialty segments, resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $351.9 million and added 8.9 percentage points to the combined ratio;
•Gross Premiums Written - our gross premiums written increased by $2.0 billion, or 34.9%, to $7.8 billion, in 2021, compared to 2020, with an increase of $959.6 million in the Property segment and an increase of $1.1 billion in the Casualty and Specialty segment. The increase was driven by growth from both new and existing business and rate improvements across both segments and a number of our underwriting platforms, and, in our Property segment, reinstatement premiums of $348.0 million associated with 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses, as compared to $79.2 million of reinstatement premiums in 2020 associated with the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and $28.0 million associated with COVID-19 losses in 2020;
•Investment Results - our total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments, was $101.3 million in 2021, compared to $1.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.1 billion. The primary driver of the lower total investment result, for 2021, was the net realized and unrealized losses on our fixed maturity trading portfolio, partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains on our equity investments trading portfolio. The higher investment results in 2020 were favorably impacted by the market recovery following the disruption in global financial markets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests - our net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $63.3 million in 2021, compared to net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest of $230.7 million in 2020, reflecting the impact of higher underwriting losses in DaVinci, lower underwriting income in Vermeer, and a decrease in Medici net income, primarily due to foreign exchange losses that are attributable to third party investors.","Net loss attributable to RenaissanceRe common shareholders was $73.4 million in 2021, compared to net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $731.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $804.9 million.

Item 7,Results of Operations for 2020 Compared to 2019,"Net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders was $731.5 million in 2020, compared to $712.0 million in 2019, an increase of $19.4 million. As a result of our net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders in 2020, we generated an annualized return on average common equity of 11.7% and our book value per common share increased from $120.53 at December 31, 2019 to $138.46 at December 31, 2020, a 16.0% increase, after considering the change in accumulated dividends paid to our common shareholders.
The most significant items affecting our financial performance during 2020, on a comparative basis to 2019, include:
•Impact of Weather-Related Large Loss Events and COVID-19 - in 2020, we had a net negative impact on our net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $493.6 million resulting from the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and $286.6 million resulting from losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This compares to a net negative impact on our net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $348.2 million from the combined impacts of the 2019 Large Loss Events.
•Underwriting Results - we incurred an underwriting loss of $76.5 million and had a combined ratio of 101.9% in 2020, compared to underwriting income of $256.4 million and a combined ratio of 92.3% in 2019. Our underwriting loss in 2020 was comprised of an $87.5 million underwriting loss in our Casualty and Specialty segment, offset by underwriting income of $11.2 million in our Property segment. In comparison, underwriting income in 2019 was comprised of $209.3 million of underwriting income in our Property segment and $46.0 million of underwriting income in our Casualty and Specialty segment.
Our underwriting result in 2020 was principally impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and the COVID-19 losses. The 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $668.5 million and added 17.2 percentage points to the combined ratio, primarily in the Property segment. The COVID-19 losses, which impacted both the Property and Casualty and Specialty segments, resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $351.9 million and added 8.9 percentage points to the combined ratio.
Partially offsetting the impact of the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years of $183.8 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded recoveries. This favorable development reduced the combined ratio by 4.6 percentage points and was principally in the Property segment.
In comparison, our underwriting result in 2019 was principally impacted by the 2019 Large Loss Events, which had a net negative impact on our underwriting result of $418.9 million and added 12.9 percentage points to the combined ratio, principally in the Property segment;
•Gross Premiums Written - our gross premiums written increased by $1.0 billion, or 20.8%, to $5.8 billion, in 2020, compared to 2019, with an increase of $568.2 million in the Property segment and an increase of $430.3 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment;
•Investment Results - our total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains on investments, was $1.2 billion in 2020, compared to $838.3 million in 2019, an increase of $336.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $820.6 million in 2020, compared to $414.1 million in 2019. The net realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2020 were driven by net realized and unrealized gains on the fixed maturity investments portfolio, equity investments trading and investment-related derivatives;
•Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests - our net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $230.7 million in 2020, compared to $201.5 million in 2019. The increase was due to improved performance from Medici and Vermeer, compared to 2019, partially offset by lower underlying performance in DaVinci which was negatively impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and the COVID-19 losses; and Common Share Offering - on June 5, 2020, we issued 6,325,000 of our common shares in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $166.00 per share. Concurrently with the public offering, we raised $75.0 million through the issuance of 451,807 of our common shares at a price of $166.00 per share to State Farm, one of our existing stockholders, in a private placement.

Item 7,Net Negative Impact,"Net negative impact on underwriting result includes the sum of (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred, (2) assumed and ceded reinstatement premiums earned and (3) earned and lost profit commissions. Net negative impact on net income (loss) available (attributable) to RenaissanceRe common shareholders is the sum of (1) net negative impact on underwriting result and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interest, before consideration of any related income tax benefit (expense). Our estimates of net negative impact are based on a review of our potential exposures, preliminary discussions with certain counterparties and actuarial modeling techniques. Our actual net negative impact, both individually and in the aggregate, may vary from these estimates, perhaps materially. Changes in these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur.
Meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimates and the nature and extent of the losses from catastrophe events, driven by the magnitude and recent nature of each event, the geographic areas impacted by the events, relatively limited claims data received to date, the contingent nature of business interruption and other exposures, potential uncertainties relating to reinsurance recoveries and other factors inherent in loss estimation, among other things.","Net negative impact on underwriting result includes the sum of (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred, (2) assumed and ceded reinstatement premiums earned and (3) earned and lost profit commissions.

Item 7,Property Gross Premiums Written,"In 2021, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $959.6 million, or 32.0%, to $4.0 billion, compared to $3.0 billion in 2020.
Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $349.0 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020. The increase in gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business included $339.7 million of reinstatement premiums associated with the 2021 Weather-Related Large Losses, compared to reinstatement premiums of $77.0 million associated with the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and $25.9 million associated with COVID-19 losses in 2020. The growth in 2021 was also driven by an improved rate environment, increased shares on existing deals, participation in new deals and opportunities across underwriting platforms.
Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $610.6 million, or 54.9%, compared to 2020. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by rate improvements which contributed to growth in new and existing business written in the current and prior periods across underwriting platforms. This included growth in catastrophe exposed U.S. property excess and surplus lines.
In 2020, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $568.2 million, or 23.4%, to $3.0 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019.
Gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business were $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $291.3 million, or 18.3%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business in 2020 was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions, certain new transactions, rate improvements and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
Gross premiums written in our other property class of business were $1.1 billion in 2020, an increase of $276.8 million, or 33.1%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in our other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of our underwriting platforms, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
As our other property class of business has become a larger percentage of our Property segment gross premiums written, the amount of proportional business has increased. Proportional business typically has a higher expense ratio and combined ratio than traditional excess of loss reinsurance.
Our Property segment gross premiums written continue to be characterized by a large percentage of U.S. and Caribbean premium, as we have found business derived from exposures in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world to be, in general, less attractive on a risk-adjusted basis during recent periods. A significant amount of our U.S. and Caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms, notably U.S. Atlantic windstorms, as well as earthquakes and other natural and man-made catastrophes.","Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $349.0 million, or 18.5%, compared to 2020.

Item 1,Segments and Corporate & Other,"Our businesses in the U.S. segment offer a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. Our U.S. segment is organized into three businesses: Group Benefits, Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”) and Property & Casualty.
We have built a leading position in the United States group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in the United States.
Our Group Benefits business offers life insurance, dental, group short- and long-term disability (“LTD”), individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment (“AD&D”) insurance, vision, and accident & health insurance, as well as prepaid legal plans. We also sell administrative services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's acquisition of Versant Health, Inc. (“Versant Health”), a managed vision care company.
We distribute Group Benefits products and services through a sales force primarily comprised of MetLife employees that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Account executives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products.
We have entered into several operating joint ventures and other arrangements with third parties to expand opportunities to market and distribute Group Benefits products and services. We also sell our Group Benefits products and services through sponsoring associations and affinity groups and provide life, dental, accident & health, and vision coverage to certain employees of the U.S. Government. We have longstanding relationships with these employees and continue to cultivate and expand them through additional product offerings.
Group Benefits business quarterly claims experience may vary, as seasonal illnesses effect mortality and morbidity and due to utilization rate fluctuation in our non-medical health businesses. Annual benefit renewal implementation, enrollment, and marketing costs normally elevate Group Benefits business’ expenses in the fourth quarter.

Item 1,Policyholder Liabilities,"We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the investments we make with the premiums we receive. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Future Policy Benefits” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder Liabilities.”
MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, establish statutory reserves under methods prescribed by insurance laws. These reserves are reported as liabilities, and we expect them to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits reported under GAAP generally differ due to the difference in accounting requirements.
U.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit an annual opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary. In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses.
Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See “— Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.”","Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims.

In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses. See “— Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.”"
Item 1,Underwriting,"Our underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.Insurance underwriters consider an applicant’s medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.We periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.
We use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies that we intend to be competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers’ needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing.
For our Property & Casualty business, our underwriting function has six principal aspects: evaluating potential voluntary and worksite employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable issuance of a policy within our guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates commensurate with risk. Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the distribution channels have binding authority for risks which fall within our published underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any policy.
We continually review our underwriting guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.

Item 1,Pricing,"Product pricing reflects our globally-consistent standards. Global Risk Management and regional finance and product teams’ price and oversee all of our insurance businesses. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results.
Our pricing of certain products may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. For prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on prior years’ experience.
We base our rates for group benefit products on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business. We generally re-evaluate renewals annually or biannually and re-price products to reflect our experience on such products.
We price RIS products on demand. Our pricing reflects our expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions. RIS business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. However for our stable value business, pricing reflects the contractholders ability to withdraw at book value over a period of time as well as our ability to reset rates periodically.
We generally must receive regulatory approval of rates for individual life insurance products. Such rates are highly regulated, even where we are not required to obtain advance regulatory approval. We generally renew such products annually, and they may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time.
We price individual disability income products based on anticipated results by occupation.
Our rates for fixed and variable annuity products are also highly regulated, and we also generally must receive regulatory approval of them. Such products generally include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor benefits to policyholder needs. We periodically reevaluate the costs of such options and adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. We may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features we offer.For our Property & Casualty business, our ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory oversight. Rates for our major lines of property and casualty insurance are based on our proprietary database, rather than relying on rating bureaus. We determine prices in part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account, among other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and other administrative and overhead costs such as reinsurance), competitive factors and profit considerations. The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the insured’s personal financial management. As a condition of our license to do business in each state, we, like all other personal lines insurers, are required to write or share the cost of private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance for higher risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This “involuntary” market, also called the “shared market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations of each state, and policies written in this market are generally written at rates higher than standard rates and typically afford less coverage.

Item 1,Reinsurance Activity,"We enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products. We also provide reinsurance for some third parties’ insurance products. We participate in reinsurance in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. We reinsure both mortality and other risks. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.
We also reinsure for risk and capital management purposes among affiliates, including affiliated captive reinsurers. Captive reinsurers are affiliated insurance companies licensed as such under the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by several states, including Vermont and South Carolina. Captive insurers’ very narrow business plans restrict most or all of their activity to reinsuring business from their affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.”
For information regarding reinsurance by segment, our catastrophic coverage, and ceded reinsurance recoverable balances, included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.","We enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products.

Item 1,Regulation- Overview,"In the United States (“U.S.”), state regulators primarily regulate our life insurance companies, with additional federal regulation of some products and services. The insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions apply to MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Furthermore, consumer protection laws, privacy, anti-money laundering, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) also apply to some of MetLife’s operations, products and services.
Outside of the U.S., insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate principally regulate those businesses. In addition, securities, pension, and other authorities oversee our investment and pension companies where they operate. Regulators also subject our non-U.S. insurance businesses to current and developing solvency regimes, which impose various capital and other requirements. Additionally, regulators may enhance their capital standards, enhance their supervision, and impose additional non-U.S. and global regulatory initiatives.
We expect the scope and extent of regulation and regulatory oversight generally to continue to increase. The regulatory environment and changes in laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially harm our results of operations.","Furthermore, consumer protection laws, privacy, anti-money laundering, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) also apply to some of MetLife’s operations, products and services.

We expect the scope and extent of regulation and regulatory oversight generally to continue to increase."
Item 1,Insurance Regulation,"Insurance regulation generally aims to protect policyholders and ensure insurance company solvency. Insurance regulators increasingly seek information about the potential impact of activities on holding company systems as a whole, and some jurisdictions have asserted “group-wide” supervision, including model laws and regulations developed through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (“NAIC”) Solvency Modernization Initiative. See “— National Association of Insurance Commissioners” regarding group-wide supervision.
Each of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions regulate the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers through broad administrative powers with respect to, amongst other things, licensing companies and agents to transact business;calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;mandating certain insurance benefits;regulating certain premium rates;
reviewing and approving certain policy forms, including required policyholder disclosures;
regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states or local authorities benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners;regulating advertising;protecting and safeguarding personal information and other sensitive data, including through cybersecurity standards;establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;specifying the conditions under which a ceding company can take credit for reinsurance in its statutory financial statements (i.e., reduce its reserves by the amount of reserves ceded to a reinsurer);fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;adopting and enforcing sales standards with respect to the sale of annuities and other insurance products;approving changes in control of insurance companies;restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and regulating the types and amounts of investments.
Each insurance subsidiary must file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business. Such authorities also periodically examine its operations and accounts. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval of, rules, rates, and policy forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
Insurance, securities, and other regulatory authorities, other law enforcement agencies, and attorneys general, review MetLife, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries for compliance with laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2020, many government actors and insurance regulators issued regulations, bulletins, directives and guidance in connection with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”), some of which have since expired. These encourage, request or direct health, life, and property and casualty insurance companies to waive cost-sharing for coronavirus COVID-19 testing, cover telehealth services, provide extended grace periods for premium payments, forbear on the cancellation or non-renewal of policies due to non-payment of premium, expand coverage for state-mandated disability and family leave benefits to address COVID-19-related events, and provide other policyholder accommodations. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services (""NYDFS"") required life insurance- or annuity- authorized insurers to extend premium and fee payment grace periods to 90 days for policyholders who demonstrated COVID-19 Pandemic-related financial hardship. The NYDFS also prohibited New York licensed insurers from imposing any late fees on or reporting policyholders to a credit reporting or debt collection agency for failure to timely pay any life or annuity premiums, and required such insurers to allow policyholders to pay the premium over a 12-month period. Insurers were required to accept a policyholder’s written attestation as proof of financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Item 1,U.S. Federal Initiatives,"U.S. federal initiatives often affect our business in a variety of ways, including regulation of financial services, securities, derivatives, pensions, health care, money laundering, foreign sanctions and corrupt practices, and taxation. In addition, legislators and policymakers propose various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) increased the potential federal role in regulating businesses such as ours, including in the following ways:The Financial Stability Oversight Council may designate certain financial companies as non-bank systemically important financial institutions (“non-bank SIFI”) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the “Federal Reserve”).The Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury may participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., collect information about the insurance industry, and recommend prudential standards.If an insurance holding company such as MetLife, Inc. or another non-insurance financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations, and regulators determined that this would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S., then the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) may liquidate such a company as receiver. In that case, the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations, would not apply. The FDIC’s purpose would be to mitigate the systemic risks the institution’s failure poses. This is a different objective from that of a bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. In such a liquidation, the holders of such company’s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has established rules relating to the priority of creditors’ claims and the potentially dissimilar treatment of similarly situated creditors. These provisions could apply to some financial institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our investment portfolios. However, state insurance laws would continue to apply to an insurance company resolution. Dodd-Frank provisions may also affect the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including imposing federal regulation of such activities.
Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations have changed since the law was adopted. As a result of these changes, and potential changes, we cannot identify all the risks and opportunities, if any, they pose to our businesses. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”The federal government's 2020 response to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected us. For example, the U.S. federal government established paid sick leave and expanded other leave laws to cover certain COVID-19 Pandemic related events. The U.S. federal government also added certain tax-favored withdrawals and increased loan withdrawal limitations from eligible retirement plans, and temporarily waived required minimum distribution rules for qualified retirement plan participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRA”) owners. We also granted concessions to certain of our commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications, as well as to certain of our lessees (operating and direct financing leases), primarily in the form of rent deferrals. In addition, we have made certain accounting elections regarding loan and lease concessions related to the Federal Government’s pandemic relief efforts. See “Investments — Mortgage Loans — Mortgage Loan Concessions” and “Investments — Leases — Lease Concessions” in Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Until January 2021, the McCarran–Ferguson Act largely exempted insurance from U.S. antitrust laws. At that time, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act applied U.S. antitrust laws to the “business of health insurance” and expanded U.S. regulatory authority accordingly. We expect regulatory oversight and litigation risk for U.S. products, including dental and vision, to increase.

Item 1,Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities,"U.S. state insurance departments periodically examine the books, records, accounts, and business practices of their domiciled insurers. State insurance departments may also conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers licensed in their states.
In 2019, MetLife entered into a consent order with the NYDFS relating to the open market conduct quinquennial exam and paid a fine and customer restitution and submitted remediation plans for approval. Except for this consent order or as described in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries.
In 2018, Pennsylvania, California, Florida, North Dakota and New Hampshire insurance regulators scheduled a multistate market conduct re-examination of MetLife and its affiliates relating to compliance with a regulatory settlement agreement on unclaimed proceeds. This examination is ongoing.
Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and, occasionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) have conducted investigations or made inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities or other products written by our insurance or broker-dealer subsidiaries. These investigations often focus on the conduct and/or supervision of particular financial services representatives, the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products, the misuse of client assets, or sales and replacements of annuities and certain riders on such annuities. Over the past several years, we resolved these (and a number of investigations by other regulators) for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to receive, and may resolve, further investigations and actions on these matters in a similar manner.
Insurance standard-setting and regulatory support organizations, including the NAIC, encourage insurance supervisors to establish Supervisory Colleges. These organizations facilitate cooperation and coordination among insurance supervisors to enhance their understanding of the risk profile of U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations. MetLife’s lead state regulator, the NYDFS, regularly chairs Supervisory College meetings that MetLife’s key U.S. and non-U.S. regulators attend.
Regulators supervise our non-U.S. insurance and pension businesses through periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”), along with European legislation, requires European regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, to establish Supervisory Colleges for European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based insurance groups with significant European operations, including MetLife. These colleges facilitate cooperation and coordination among European supervisors to enhance their understanding of an insurance group’s risk profile.
In 2019, we and other insurance and pension fund companies provided annuities sales practices information to the Chilean insurance and pension regulators. The regulators found that non-employee sales agents of MetLife Chile and other insurers had engaged in improper sales practices and that ProVida S.A. and other pension fund companies provided improper advice to customers. MetLife Chile and ProVida S.A. are contesting the regulators’ proposed fines.
In addition, regulators have scrutinized insurers’ claims payment practices. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding group annuity benefits, retained asset accounts and unclaimed property inquiries, including pension benefits.","U.S. state insurance departments periodically examine the books, records, accounts, and business practices of their domiciled insurers.

Item 1,Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis,"Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, must annually analyze their statutory reserves adequacy. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. The actuary considers the adequacy of the statutory reserves in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items, such as the investment earnings on such assets and the consideration the insurer anticipates receiving and retaining under the related policies and contracts. We may increase reserves in order to submit such an opinion without qualification. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries that must provide these opinions have done so without qualifications since this requirement began.
Many of our non-U.S. insurance operations must also analyze the adequacy of their statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an analysis of the likelihood that the reserves make adequate provision for the insurer’s associated contractual obligations and related expenses. Regulatory and actuarial analytic standards vary widely.","In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. Many of our non-U.S. insurance operations must also analyze the adequacy of their statutory reserves. Regulatory and actuarial analytic standards vary widely."
Item 1,National Association of Insurance Commissioners,"The NAIC assists U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities to serve the public interest and achieve their regulatory goals. State insurance regulators may act independently or adopt regulations proposed by the NAIC. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing insurance laws and regulations. State insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate their regulatory oversight through the NAIC. The NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the “Manual”), which states have largely adopted by regulation. However, individual states establish statutory accounting principles, which may differ from the Manual. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may affect the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
U.S. state insurance holding company laws and regulations are generally based on the NAIC Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (i.e., insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register and file reports with state regulatory authorities on its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. They require the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer to file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurance holding company system. This report identifies risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has enacted laws to implement these requirements, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. The holding company laws also authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”), as well as other insurers that choose to opt in for the group-wide supervision. These laws provide confidentiality protection for communications with the group-wide supervisor. Nearly all states have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision. In 2020, the NYDFS amended its laws to permit the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (“Superintendent”) to act as a group-wide supervisor for IAIGs.
In furtherance of the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative,” the NAIC has updated model acts and regulations to address insurance company financial regulation, and in particular capital requirements; corporate governance and risk management practices; group supervision; liquidity stress testing, statutory accounting and financial reporting; and reinsurance.
The NAIC’s Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act requires insurers to annually file detailed information regarding their corporate governance policies. As of December 31, 2020, it had been substantially adopted by most states.
Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires insurers to maintain a risk management framework and to document an internal own risk and solvency assessment (“ORSA”) of its material risks in normal and stressed environments. MetLife, Inc. has submitted on behalf of the enterprise an ORSA summary report to the NYDFS annually since this requirement became effective.
The NAIC has also approved a valuation manual containing a principle-based approach to the calculation of life insurance reserves (the “Valuation Manual”). Principle-based reserving (“PBR”) is designed to better address reserving for life insurance and annuity products. Principle-based reserving has been adopted by all the domiciliary states of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries. The NYDFS promulgated a regulation in 2019 that affirms the Superintendent’s authority to deviate from the Valuation Manual to adjust the reserves of a New York domestic life insurance company, such as MLIC, if the NYDFS determines that an alternative requirement would be in the best interest of New York policyholders. In February 2020, the NYDFS amended the regulation. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we increased our statutory reserves by approximately $700 million and our statutory capital requirements by approximately $300 million over the prior reserve and capital requirements. We graded these effects into our statutory financial statements over a one year period so the full impact is reflected as of December 31, 2020.
The NAIC has been focused on a macro-prudential initiative since 2017, which is intended to enhance risk identification efforts by building on the state-based regulation system. In furtherance of this initiative, the NAIC adopted changes to its Statutory Annual Statement reporting, effective for year-end 2019, to improve liquidity risk monitoring. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Holding Company Holding Act and Regulation that implement requirements related to a liquidity stress-testing framework, consistent with MetLife’s liquidity risks policies and procedures, for certain large U.S. life insurers and insurance groups, to be used as a regulatory tool, based on amounts of certain types of business written or material exposure to certain investment transactions, such as derivatives and securities lending. These amendments now have to be adopted by state legislatures to become effective.
We use capital markets solutions to finance a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products. These include level premium term life product subject to the NAIC’s Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as Guideline AXXX), and MLIC’s closed block. The NAIC created a regulatory framework applicable to the use of captive insurers in connection with Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX transactions which has enhanced statutory financial statement disclosure of an insurer's use of captives. The framework narrowed the types of assets permitted to back statutory reserves that are required to support the insurer’s future obligations.The NAIC also requires the actuary of a ceding insurer to opine on the insurer’s reserves and to issue a qualified opinion if the framework described above, as set forth in Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG 48”), is not followed. The NAIC’s Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation contains the same substantive requirements as AG 48, as amended by the NAIC in 2016, and it establishes uniform, national standards governing reserve financing arrangements pertaining to the term life and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. This model regulation has only been adopted by a few states, including one of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states.
We cannot predict the capital and reserve impacts, compliance costs, or other effects these initiatives will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
","State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing insurance laws and regulations. However, individual states establish statutory accounting principles, which may differ from the Manual. U.S. state insurance holding company laws and regulations are generally based on the NAIC Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has enacted laws to implement these requirements, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. In 2020, the NYDFS amended its laws to permit the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (“Superintendent”) to act as a group-wide supervisor for IAIGs. In furtherance of the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative,” the NAIC has updated model acts and regulations to address insurance company financial regulation, and in particular capital requirements; corporate governance and risk management practices; group supervision; liquidity stress testing, statutory accounting and financial reporting; and reinsurance. The NAIC’s Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act requires insurers to annually file detailed information regarding their corporate governance policies. MetLife, Inc. has submitted on behalf of the enterprise an ORSA summary report to the NYDFS annually since this requirement became effective. Principle-based reserving has been adopted by all the domiciliary states of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries. The NYDFS promulgated a regulation in 2019 that affirms the Superintendent’s authority to deviate from the Valuation Manual to adjust the reserves of a New York domestic life insurance company, such as MLIC, if the NYDFS determines that an alternative requirement would be in the best interest of New York policyholders. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we increased our statutory reserves by approximately $700 million and our statutory capital requirements by approximately $300 million over the prior reserve and capital requirements. We graded these effects into our statutory financial statements over a one year period so the full impact is reflected as of December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Holding Company Holding Act and Regulation that implement requirements related to a liquidity stress-testing framework, consistent with MetLife’s liquidity risks policies and procedures, for certain large U.S. life insurers and insurance groups, to be used as a regulatory tool, based on amounts of certain types of business written or material exposure to certain investment transactions, such as derivatives and securities lending. These include level premium term life product subject to the NAIC’s Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as Guideline AXXX), and MLIC’s closed block. The framework narrowed the types of assets permitted to back statutory reserves that are required to support the insurer’s future obligations.The NAIC also requires the actuary of a ceding insurer to opine on the insurer’s reserves and to issue a qualified opinion if the framework described above, as set forth in Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG 48”), is not followed. We cannot predict the capital and reserve impacts, compliance costs, or other effects these initiatives will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations."
Item 1,Surplus and Capital,"Insurers must maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels prescribed by the laws of their respective jurisdictions. Regulators generally have discretionary authority to limit or prohibit an insurer’s sales to policyholders if the insurer has not maintained a minimum surplus or capital or if they find that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders.
State insurance statutes also typically restrict the dividends or other distributions an insurance company subsidiary may pay to its parent companies and limit the transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends in excess of prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require the approval of the insurance regulator in the insurer’s state of domicile. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” See also “Dividend Restrictions” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations.
Non-U.S. jurisdictions also restrict the amount of such dividends and other distributions. For example, a portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the Financial Services Agency in Japan (“FSA”) may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons.
Several non-U.S. insurance regulators urged insurance companies to preserve funds during the COVID-19 Pandemic. For example, the EIOPA suggested that insurance companies temporarily suspend discretionary dividends during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
For developments that could affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings results, and thus our surplus and capital, see “Risk Factors.”
Risk-Based Capital
Most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements developed by the NAIC and adopted by their respective domiciliary states. Insurers calculate RBC annually based on a formula that applies factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items, taking into account asset, insurance, interest rate, and market and business risk characteristics. Regulators use the formula as an early warning tool to identify insurers that may be inadequately capitalized for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. We expect our statutory financial statements to reflect that the total adjusted capital of each of our subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels at year-end 2020, as they did for year-end 2019. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Statutory Capital and Dividends.”
The NYDFS issues annual letters on Special Considerations (“SCL”) to New York-licensed insurance companies, including MLIC, that affect year-end asset adequacy testing. An SCL could require assumptions that require us to increase or release certain asset adequacy reserves, which could materially impact our statutory capital and surplus. We did not change our statutory capital and surplus in either 2019 or 2020 as a result of the SCL. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We calculate our internally-defined “Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio” by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc.’s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company. (“American Life”), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries, including SCL considerations. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 350% at December 31, 2020 and in excess of 360% at December 31, 2019. By contrast, we calculate an “NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio” based on such subsidiaries’ statutory-based filed financial statements and NAIC capital and reserving standards. This NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 380% at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. We are not aware of any upcoming NAIC adoptions or state insurance department regulation changes that would have a material impact on our NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio.
The NAIC adopted revisions to certain factors used to calculate Life RBC, which is the denominator of the RBC ratios, in light of changes to U.S. tax laws in recent years. These revisions have resulted in increased RBC charges and reduced the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC is also studying RBC revisions for real estate equity, bonds and longevity risk, but it is premature to project the impact of any potential regulatory changes resulting from such proposals.
The NAIC developed a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation Template and Instructions, as well as amendments to the Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. The amendments implement the annual filing requirement for the group capital calculation that now have to be adopted by state legislatures or regulatory agencies to become effective. We cannot predict what impact such regulatory tool may have on our business.
In 2020, the NAIC issued guidance on RBC addressing debt restructuring due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, where the counterparty might seek concessions. The guidance provides that an insurer does not need to reclassify the RBC category of some loans or other assets on which it has granted a concession. This may avoid a higher capital charge for the asset. The NAIC extended this guidance through January 1, 2022 in further support of the use of prudent loan modifications to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Item 1,Solvency Regimes,"Our insurance business throughout the EEA is subject to the Solvency II Directive and its implementing rules. These cover the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers. Solvency II harmonizes insurance regulation across the European Union (“EU”). Each EEA member state has transposed the Solvency II Directive into its regulatory architecture. Its capital requirements are forward-looking and based on the risk profile of each individual insurance company in order to promote comparability, transparency and competitiveness. In line with the requirements, impacted MetLife entities calculate and report their solvency capital requirement using a standard formula prescribed by the Solvency II Directive and further regulation by the European Commission.
The U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU in January 2020, and following the expiry of a transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. is no longer subject to EU law. The relationship between the U.K. and the EU is now governed by the terms and conditions of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “Trade Agreement”). The Trade Agreement does not contain many substantive provisions relating to financial services and, therefore, there is currently no change to capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements for U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers. However, it is possible that the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime may begin to diverge from the Solvency II Directive over time. The U.K. is currently undertaking a review of the Solvency II Directive and of the regulatory regime that is applicable to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers. We expect to maintain our existing operating model, including as an inbound EEA-insurer, under the U.K.’s Temporary Permissions Regime (“TPR”), which is due to last for at least three years and will permit MetLife to carry on its insurance business in the U.K. during that period.
Mexico has adopted a Solvency II-type regulatory framework which imposes reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance to foster transparency. In line with the requirements of the local Solvency II, insurance companies calculate and report their capital requirement using a standard formula designed by the local regulators (“CNSF”). In addition, as required, certain MetLife entities must submit annual ORSA reports to the CNSF on an ongoing basis.
In Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation continues in the studies stage. The implementation date for the new solvency regime has not yet been set; however, it could be in force within four years after the final regulation is published. MetLife Chile timely implemented governance changes and risk policies to comply with prior regulatory changes. MetLife Chile also submitted its most recent risk appetite framework and ORSA reports to the regulator in December 2020.
The Superintendence of Private Insurance, the Brazilian insurance regulator, has established an insurance framework for minimum capital requirements based on risk, criteria for investment activities, a formal risk management function, and a formal enterprise risk management framework. MetLife Brazil has formalized the designation of a local risk manager and implemented governance structures and risk management framework components in accordance with local regulatory requirements.
Japanese law requires insurers to maintain solvency standards to protect policyholders and to support their own financial strength. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. In addition, we expect Japan to introduce an economic value-based solvency regime within the next few years.
In China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) has been implementing China Risk Oriented Solvency System (“C-ROSS”), a risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process).
The Korea Financial Supervisory Service plans to implement a new solvency system by 2023. We expect this system to reflect the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) global Insurance Capital Standard and incorporate certain product portfolio and other features specific to the Korean market. We also expect this system to include mark-to-market valuation, which would generally increase capital requirements.","Solvency II harmonizes insurance regulation across the European Union (“EU”).

Item 1,Cybersecurity and Privacy Regulation,"Various U.S. federal and state government agencies protect the privacy and security of personal information. A number of jurisdictions outside the U.S. safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. These laws and rules vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Insurance and other regulators are also increasingly focused on cybersecurity.
New York’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions, including banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction, requires these entities to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data. The regulation requires covered entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such systems and data. Specifically, it provides for: (i) controls relating to the governance framework for a cybersecurity program; (ii) risk-based minimum standards for technology systems for data protection; (iii) minimum standards for cyber breach responses, including notice to the NYDFS of material events; and (iv) identification and documentation of material deficiencies, remediation plans and annual certifications of regulatory compliance to the NYDFS.
The NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Cybersecurity Model Law”) established standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes regulatory requirements intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems. Several states have adopted the Cybersecurity Model Law, including some of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states.
California residents have the right to know what information a business has collected from them and the sourcing and sharing of that information. They also have a right to have a business delete their personal information (with some exceptions), and in certain instances, to limit the use of their personal information. Regulators may impose fines for violations, and individuals have a private right of action for any unauthorized disclosure of personal information as a result of failure to maintain reasonable security procedures. While a significant portion of our business is exempted from these specific requirements, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the insurance laws of several states grant similar rights to insureds.
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) establishes uniform data privacy laws across the EU. The U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018 (“U.K. GDPR”) implements provisions of the GDPR with respect to personal data originating from within the U.K. GDPR and the U.K. GDPR apply to EU and U.K. entities, respectively, as well as entities not established in the EU and/or the U.K., that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EU and/or the U.K., or monitor consumer behavior that takes place in the EU and/or the U.K. Regulators may impose fines for non-compliance. Following the U.K.’s exit from the EU, the U.K. GDPR may diverge from GDPR over time.

Item 1A,Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks,"Market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, business investment, volatility, disruptions and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, and government actions may result in investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.
Higher unemployment, changes to inflation, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, lower consumer spending, elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations, lapses or surrenders of policies, reduced demand for our products, and deferred or canceled payments of insurance premiums may negatively affect our earnings and capitalization.
Declining equity markets may decrease the account value of our products, reducing certain fees generated by these products, which may increase the level of insurance liabilities we carry, accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), and increase funding to our captive reinsurers. Additionally, lower interest rates may reduce returns in fixed income investments.","Market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, business investment, volatility, disruptions and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, and government actions may result in investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions. Declining equity markets may decrease the account value of our products, reducing certain fees generated by these products, which may increase the level of insurance liabilities we carry, accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), and increase funding to our captive reinsurers."
Item 1A,Interest Rate Risks,"Some of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.
Low interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.
Lower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.
Interest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This may result in cash outflows requiring the sale of investments on less favorable terms, resulting in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (“VOBA”), reducing net income, harming our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fixed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. We would recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.
Federal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.
The measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may not be able to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders’ equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Item 1A,Equity Risks,"Downturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products’ revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products’ revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.
Sustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.
The timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds’ need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.","Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.

Item 1A,Obligor and Counterparty Risks,"Our general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.
The issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Additionally, the change in value of underlying collateral within asset-backed securities (“ABS”), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.
Many of our transactions with counterparties such as brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies, such as controlling investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks’ credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.
Our efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.

Item 1A,Currency Exchange Rate Risks,"Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also make certain of our products less attractive to customers, which may increase levels of early policy terminations and decrease sales volume and our in-force business. Such negative effects may be exacerbated if international markets experience severe economic or financial disruptions or significant currency devaluations, if a foreign economy is determined to be “highly inflationary,” or if a country withdraws from the Euro zone. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our operations, earnings or investments in the affected countries.
We may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the translation of results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.","Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. We may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors."
Item 1A,Derivatives Risks,"If our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives, our risks may not be hedged. A counterparty, clearing broker, or central clearinghouse may become insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or to return collateral under the terms of derivatives agreements, increasing our costs. If the net estimated fair value of a derivative to which we are a party declines, we may need to pledge collateral or make payments. In addition, we may face increased costs to the extent we replace counterparties who suffer financial difficulties. Furthermore, our derivatives valuations may change based on changes to our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology.","If our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives, our risks may not be hedged. Furthermore, our derivatives valuations may change based on changes to our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology."
Item 1A,Terrorism and Security Risks,"The continued threat of terrorism, ongoing or potential military and other actions, and heightened security measures may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by such threats. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions, and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist or military actions also could disrupt our operations centers and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.In cases of volatility, disruptions, or other conditions in global capital markets we may have to seek additional financing, the availability and cost of which could be adversely affected by market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to our industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, reduced business activity, or investment losses, and the perception of our financial prospects. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing we need on favorable terms or at all. We may be required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or post collateral or make payments related to specified counterparty agreements.
Our business and financial results may suffer without sufficient liquidity through impaired ability to pay claims, other operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, cash or collateral to our subsidiaries, maintain our securities lending, replace certain maturing liabilities, sustain our operations and investments, and repurchase our common stock. Capital and credit market volatility may limit our access to capital we need to operate, limiting our ability to raise capital, issue the types of securities we would prefer, timely replace maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory requirements, and access capital to grow our business, any of which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.","The continued threat of terrorism, ongoing or potential military and other actions, and heightened security measures may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity.

Item1A,Operational Risks,"Our enterprise risk management and business continuity policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed. Pandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) have caused and may continue to cause extended remote work periods and other unusual conditions. These may strain our risk management and our business continuity plans, introduce or increase our operational and cybersecurity risks, and otherwise impair our ability to manage our business. They may increase the frequency and sophistication of attempts at unauthorized access to our technology systems. They may hinder our efforts to prevent money-laundering or other fraud, whether due to limited abilities to “know our customers,” strains on our programs to avoid and deter foreign corrupt practices, or otherwise, and may both increase our compliance costs and our risk of violations.
The assumptions, projections and data on which our risk management models are based may be inaccurate, and our models may not be suitable for their purpose, be misused, not operate properly, and contain errors.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

,"Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies","Liabilities for universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), and are thus subject to the same variability and risk as further discussed herein. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of appropriate underlying equity indices, such as the S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) 500 Index. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.The Company regularly reviews its estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience. Differences result in changes to the liability balances with related charges or credits to benefit expenses in the period in which the changes occur.Policyholder account balances relate to contracts or contract features where the Company has no significant insurance risk.The Company issues directly and assumes through reinsurance variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit adjusted for withdrawals. These guarantees are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid without requiring (i) the occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) the policyholder to annuitize. Alternatively, a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) annuitization. In certain cases, a guarantee may have elements of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases the guarantee is split and accounted for under both models.
Guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities in future policy benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDBs”), the life-contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWBs”), elective annuitizations of guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIBs”), and the life contingent portion of GMIBs that require annuitization when the account balance goes to zero.Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMABs”), the non-life contingent portion of GMWBs and certain non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees.
Other policy-related balances include policy and contract claims, premiums received in advance, unearned revenue liabilities, obligations assumed under structured settlement assignments, policyholder dividends due and unpaid, policyholder dividends left on deposit and negative value of business acquired (“VOBA”).
The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) death, disability, dental and vision claims. In addition, included in other policy-related balances are claims which have been reported but not yet settled for death, disability and dental. The liability for these claims is based on the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of IBNR claims principally from analyses of historical patterns of claims by business line. The methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made.
The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its individual life, group life and health contracts as premiums received in advance. These amounts are then recognized in premiums when due.
The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life and investment-type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to DAC as discussed further herein. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees.

Item 8,Insurance,"The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. For long duration insurance contracts, assumptions such as mortality, morbidity and interest rates are “locked in” upon the issuance of new business. However, significant adverse changes in experience on such contracts may require the establishment of premium deficiency reserves. Such reserves are determined based on the then current assumptions and do not include a provision for adverse deviation.
Premium deficiency reserves may also be established for short-duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. These reserves are based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. The provisions for unreported claims are calculated using studies that measure the historical length of time between the incurred date of a claim and its eventual reporting to the Company. Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts.

Item 8,Recognition of Insurance Revenues and Deposits,"Premiums related to traditional life, annuity contracts with life contingencies, long-duration accident & health, and credit insurance policies are recognized as revenues when due from policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided to recognize profits over the estimated lives of the insurance policies. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into earnings in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or, for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit payments.
Premiums related to short-duration non-medical health and disability, accident & health, and certain credit insurance contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term.
Deposits related to universal life and investment-type products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues from such contracts consist of fees for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges and are recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged to earnings include interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.
Premiums related to property & casualty contracts are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of premium written related to the unexpired coverage, are included in future policy benefits.
All revenues and expenses are presented net of reinsurance, as applicable.","Premiums related to traditional life, annuity contracts with life contingencies, long-duration accident & health, and credit insurance policies are recognized as revenues when due from policyholders.

Item 8,Mortgage Loans,"ASU 2016-13 requires an ACL based on expected lifetime credit loss on financing receivables carried at amortized cost, including, but not limited to, mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases, as described in Note 8.
The Company disaggregates its mortgage loan investments into three portfolio segments: commercial, agricultural and residential. Also included in commercial mortgage loans are revolving line of credit loans collateralized by commercial properties. The accounting policies that are applicable to all portfolio segments are presented below and the accounting policies related to each of the portfolio segments are included in Note 8.
Mortgage loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and are net of ACL. Interest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Interest income is recognized using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount.
The Company ceases to accrue interest when the collection of interest is not considered probable, which is based on a current evaluation of the status of the borrower, including the number of days past due. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected past due accrued interest income that is considered uncollectible is charged-off against net investment income. Generally, the accrual of interest income resumes after all delinquent amounts are paid and management believes all future principal and interest payments will be collected. The Company records cash receipts on non-accruing loans in accordance with the loan agreement. The Company records charge-offs upon the realization of a credit loss, typically through foreclosure or after a decision is made to sell a loan, or for residential loans when, after considering the individual consumer’s financial status, management believes amounts are not collectible. Gain or loss upon charge-off is recorded, net of previously established ACL, in net investment gains (losses). Cash recoveries on principal amounts previously charged-off are generally recorded in net investment gains.
Also included in mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans for which the FVO was elected, and which are stated at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.
Mortgage loans that were previously designated as held-for-investment, but now are designated as held-for-sale, are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value.","The accounting policies that are applicable to all portfolio segments are presented below and the accounting policies related to each of the portfolio segments are included in Note 8.

Item 7,Consolidated Company Outlook,"We continue to closely monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic and assess its impact on our business. The COVID-19 Pandemic continues to impact the global economy and financial markets and has caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. Governments and businesses have taken numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, shelter in place or total lock down orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Some governments and businesses have begun to ease some restrictions. Others have reinstated restrictions they previously lifted. Nevertheless, these measures have disrupted and will continue to disrupt business activity and have resulted in an economic slowdown and volatility in the financial markets, to which governments and central banks around the world have responded with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies. Although vaccines have become available, distribution and access are expected to take time before a significant percentage of the population is vaccinated. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.”
In addition, a prolonged low or near zero interest rate environment remains possible. The economic projections of the Federal Reserve Board suggest that the current low interest rate environment will continue until 2023, and potentially longer. We believe that our investment portfolio is highly diversified and well positioned to withstand economic downturns; however, we expect that the market-related effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as the sustained low interest rate environment, will continue to have an impact across our investment portfolio. See “— Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment” for discussion of the mitigating actions the Company has taken to reduce interest rate sensitivity as market interest rates are a key driver of our results.
Events related to the COVID-19 Pandemic may continue to adversely affect certain of our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results or financial condition. See “Risk Factors.” We have implemented risk management and business continuity plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, such as employee business travel restrictions and remote work arrangements which, to date, have enabled us to maintain our critical business processes, customer service levels, relationships with key vendors, financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.
We granted and continue to grant certain accommodations to our customers, borrowers and lessees, including (i) waiving exclusions, such as deferred rate increases, extending premium grace periods, waiving late payment fees, and relaxing claim documentation requirements, (ii) credits on auto and insured dental premiums, (iii) payment deferrals and other loan modifications on certain commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and (iv) certain operating and direct financing lease concessions. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related mortgage loan and lease concessions. See also, “— Results of Operations — Segment Results and Corporate & Other — U.S.”
As of December 31, 2020, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding companies which is above the high end of our $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion holding company cash target. In 2021, we expect to maintain this holding company cash target and expect to be within or above the high end of this range.
Our capital stress testing and longstanding commitment to liquidity position us to withstand the current crisis. We have, and may continue to maintain, a higher than normal level of short-term liquidity, which may adversely affect net investment income if the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. See “— Investments — Current Environment” and “Risk Factors” for additional information.
Assuming (i) interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2020, including a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 0.91% at December 31, 2020, and 1.12% at December 31, 2021, and (ii) a mid-single digit S&P 500 equity index increase for the full year 2021, we expect the average annual ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 to be 65% to 75%. In addition, we remain on track to generate approximately $20.0 billion of free cash flow over the time period of 2020 through 2024.
We continue to target an adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) other than foreign currency translation adjustments (“FCTA”) of 12% to 14% over the near-term assuming non-recessionary market conditions. However, (i) given the possible effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, (ii) given our exclusion of MetLife P&C from adjusted earnings because we expect to close its disposition in the second quarter 2021, and (iii) assuming (a) interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2020, including our updated assumptions for the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates noted in the paragraph above, (b) a mid-single digit S&P 500 equity index increase for the full year 2021, and (c) positive low double digit private equity returns in 2021, we could be below the low end of the target range in 2021.
We are fully committed to achieving a direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers below 12.3%. We expect pressure on this ratio in 2021 due to the pending disposition of MetLife P&C with its lower direct expense ratio, but we intend to continue to exercise expense discipline and be below 12.3% for 2022.
Furthermore, we also remain fully committed to our Next Horizon Strategy, which was introduced at our December 2019 Investor Day.
Our outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties, such as those posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors, we will continually review our assumptions, implementing mitigation plans, and taking precautions. We may revise our outlook as we obtain more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the effect and efficacy of efforts taken to respond to it, economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other events, and the impact of these events on our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results and financial condition.","The COVID-19 Pandemic continues to impact the global economy and financial markets and has caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets.

We granted and continue to grant certain accommodations to our customers, borrowers and lessees, including (i) waiving exclusions, such as deferred rate increases, extending premium grace periods, waiving late payment fees, and relaxing claim documentation requirements, (ii) credits on auto and insured dental premiums, (iii) payment deferrals and other loan modifications on certain commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and (iv) certain operating and direct financing lease concessions. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. However, (i) given the possible effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, (ii) given our exclusion of MetLife P&C from adjusted earnings because we expect to close its disposition in the second quarter 2021, and (iii) assuming (a) interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2020, including our updated assumptions for the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates noted in the paragraph above, (b) a mid-single digit S&P 500 equity index increase for the full year 2021, and (c) positive low double digit private equity returns in 2021, we could be below the low end of the target range in 2021. We expect pressure on this ratio in 2021 due to the pending disposition of MetLife P&C with its lower direct expense ratio, but we intend to continue to exercise expense discipline and be below 12.3% for 2022. Furthermore, we also remain fully committed to our Next Horizon Strategy, which was introduced at our December 2019 Investor Day. Our outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties, such as those posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors, we will continually review our assumptions, implementing mitigation plans, and taking precautions."
Item 7,Financial and Economic Environment,"Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”
We have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Currency Exchange Rate Risks.”
We are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, certain measures taken by governments and businesses as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic to respond to the spread of the virus have disrupted business activity and have resulted in an economic slowdown and volatility in financial markets. Governmental and non-governmental organizations may not effectively respond to the spread and severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic, increasing the magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts. We cannot yet determine or estimate the actions that will be taken, including governmental laws, regulations or orders, and the extent to which these actions have affected or will affect our business operations, investment portfolio, financial results, or financial condition. See “— Executive Summary — Consolidated Company Outlook” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”
We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the impact of the trade agreement reached by the U.K. and the EU in December 2020. See “Business — Regulation — Cross-Border Trade and Investments.” See also “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks Globally.”
Governments and central banks around the world are responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies, which are expected to have significant and ongoing effects on financial markets and the global economy. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board continues to expand its balance sheet and board members’ forecasts suggest the policy rate is likely to remain near zero through 2023. Separately, another COVID-related stimulus package has been passed. The European Central Bank has significantly increased the size of its asset purchase program, and extended its commitment to undertake purchases through 2021, reduced constraints on what and how much it can purchase, and launched new funding facilities for euro area banks, while the Bank of England significantly lowered interest rates and relaunched quantitative easing. Additionally, a number of European countries, including the U.K., have implemented large fiscal stimulus programs, as well as the provision of guarantees and loans for private sector companies. The EU approved a stimulus package comprised of grants and low interest financing to member states, which is expected to become operational in 2021.
In Japan, the Bank of Japan has accelerated its purchases of interests in index-linked securities and real estate investments, increased the annual limit on purchases of commercial paper and bonds, and introduced new measures to facilitate corporate financing, including a new lending program for businesses impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. In addition, the Japanese government approved additional stimulus measures, including provisions for cash payouts to individuals and business owners, tax reform, and zero-interest loans.
We cannot predict with certainty the actions that will be taken, effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio, financial results, or financial condition. See “— Investments — Current Environment.”
Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment
Market interest rates are a key driver of our results. Sustained periods of low U.S. interest rates may cause us to: Reduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets (“gross margin”); Reinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio; Increase our reserves or trigger loss recognition events related to policy liabilities, accelerate amortization of DAC and VOBA, and potentially impair intangible assets; Reduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values; Change our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and Experience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.
For additional discussion on gross margin and interest rate assumptions, as well as the potential impact of low interest rates, see “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019 — Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments.” See also “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks;” “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization of or Impair DAC, DSI, VOBA or VOCRA;” “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets;” and “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products.”","See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Currency Exchange Rate Risks.”

Item 7,Competitive Pressures,"The life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Business — Competition.” Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Certain of the industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the ability to leverage the capabilities of new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “Business — Regulation.” We believe that the current low interest rate environment and increased volatility of the financial markets, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, will continue to strain the life insurance industry, as well as the broader financial services industry. In addition to financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, we believe that the ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic is a significant differentiator to success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry, and we are well positioned to compete in this environment.","Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products.

Item 7,Regulatory Developments,"In the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.” Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products and, in some states, instituted a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions. See “Business — Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings,” “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.”","In the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation.

Item 7,Liability for Future Policy Benefits,"Generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.
Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.
Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.
We regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.","These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable.

We regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience."
Item 7,Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired,"We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee’s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee’s time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.
VOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
Separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 6.0%.
We periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.
Our most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $16.4 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.","We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business.

Item 7,Goodwill,"Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances that management deems a triggering event indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. Examples of such events or circumstances are changes in business climate, including disruptions in global capital markets. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests on all of its reporting units using quantitative assessments under the market multiple, embedded value and discounted cash flow valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2020. The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of all its reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.
We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.
See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill.

Item 7,Employee Benefit Plans,"Certain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.We determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2019, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $114 million and an increase of $114 million, respectively, in 2020. This considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.
We determine the discount rates used to value the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2019, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $93 million and an increase of $88 million, respectively, in 2020. This considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and liquidity.
See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.

Item 7,Income Taxes,"We provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.
In establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.
We may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.
See also Notes 1 and 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.","Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities.

Item 7,Consolidated Results — Adjusted Earnings,"Business Overview. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 decreased $7 million, or less than 1%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $340 million, or 1%, compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in our U.S. segment, despite negative impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Growth in core and voluntary products in our Group Benefits business was partially offset by a decline in our RIS business and a decrease in exposures in our Property & Casualty (“P&C”) business. The decrease in RIS was mainly driven by decreases in our structured settlement and institutional income annuity businesses, due to market conditions, partially offset by an increase in our pension risk transfer business. An increase in our EMEA segment was due to business growth across the region. In addition, an increase in our Asia segment reflects the impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review, which resulted in higher fees from foreign currency-denominated life products in 2020, partially offset by lower premiums from yen-denominated life products in Japan and the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong in 2019. A decrease in our Latin America segment was mainly driven by lower annuitizations in Chile due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses, previously included in our former retail business, that we no longer actively market in the United States. We anticipate an average decline in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% to 7% per year in our MetLife Holdings segment from expected business run-off.Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
Overview. The primary drivers of the decrease in adjusted earnings were lower investment yields and a higher effective tax rate. These declines were partially offset by higher net investment income due to a larger asset base, and a decrease in expenses, including interest credited expenses.
Foreign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an $86 million negative impact on adjusted earnings for 2020 compared to 2019. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.
Business Growth. We benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of all of our segments and Corporate & Other resulted in higher net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets, interest credited expenses on certain insurance-related liabilities increased. Also, an increase in expenses was primarily due to the 2020 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and was more than offset by a corresponding increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. In addition, lower fee income in our MetLife Holdings segment was partially offset by increases in our other segments. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, in addition to lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $451 million increase in adjusted earnings.
Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively affected by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, and lower returns on FVO Securities and real estate investments. These decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher net investment income on derivatives. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in a decline in our average interest credited rates on deposit-type and long-duration liabilities, which drove a decrease in interest credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $349 million decrease in adjusted earnings.
Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting experience resulted in an $82 million increase in adjusted earnings and reflected impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Favorable morbidity in our U.S., MetLife Holdings and EMEA segments, as well as a decrease in non-catastrophe claims in our P&C business were partially offset by unfavorable mortality in our U.S., Latin America and MetLife Holdings segments, as well as higher catastrophe-related claims in our Property & Casualty business. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $60 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to changes in economic assumptions. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities in both years resulted in an $88 million decrease in adjusted earnings, which included the impact of favorable insurance adjustments in 2019 resulting from enhancements to our claim-related processes, as well as a 2019 charge due to an increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims. Expenses. Expenses decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to declines in costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, certain corporate-related expenses and employee-related costs. The decrease in expenses resulted in a $567 million increase in adjusted earnings.
Taxes. Our 2020 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 19%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income, tax credits and the finalization of bankruptcy proceedings for a leveraged lease investment, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2019 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 10%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income and tax credits, the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate.

","Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 decreased $7 million, or less than 1%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $340 million, or 1%, compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in our U.S. segment, despite negative impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Growth in core and voluntary products in our Group Benefits business was partially offset by a decline in our RIS business and a decrease in exposures in our Property & Casualty (“P&C”) business. The decrease in RIS was mainly driven by decreases in our structured settlement and institutional income annuity businesses, due to market conditions, partially offset by an increase in our pension risk transfer business. A decrease in our Latin America segment was mainly driven by lower annuitizations in Chile due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The primary drivers of the decrease in adjusted earnings were lower investment yields and a higher effective tax rate. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items. Growth in the investment portfolios of all of our segments and Corporate & Other resulted in higher net investment income. Also, an increase in expenses was primarily due to the 2020 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and was more than offset by a corresponding increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, in addition to lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $451 million increase in adjusted earnings. Investment yields were negatively affected by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, and lower returns on FVO Securities and real estate investments.

Expenses. The decrease in expenses resulted in a $567 million increase in adjusted earnings. Our 2019 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 10%."
Item 7,Effects of Inflation,"Management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.
An increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other costs, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.

Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities."
Item 7,Investments,"Our primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investment Risk Committee and Asset-Liability Steering Committee review and monitor investment risk limits and tolerances.
We are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds; liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions; market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher credit losses. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed income investments and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio; currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including as a result of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers, tenants and our joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, changes in market interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.
We manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by the Investment Risk Committee, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies which are reviewed and approved by the Asset-Liability Steering Committee. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain NGEs of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk. We enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determines that a credit event has occurred.
We use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging, which gives us more flexibility in managing our credit exposures. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.

Item 7,Current Environment,"As a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, the fiscal and monetary policy of governments and central banks around the world and other governmental measures. The COVID-19 Pandemic continues to impact the global economy and financial markets and has caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.”
Governments and central banks around the world are responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies, which are expected to have significant and ongoing effects on financial markets and the global economy. These policy responses include fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, including, but not limited to, financial assistance, liquidity programs, new financing facilities and reductions in the level of interest rates. As time progresses, we will know more about the efficacy of these policies and what they may mean for the outlook for the global economy and financial markets, but currently the number of factors makes reliably estimating the duration and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives difficult.
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an economic slowdown and volatility in the financial markets, including liquidity driven price dislocation and credit spread widening. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the value of certain investments within our portfolio decreased; however, some of those effects were mitigated by an increase in the value of certain freestanding derivatives that hedge such market risks. These conditions may persist for some time and may continue to impact pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. Selected Country: We have a market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our investment portfolio, which supports our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, as well as our global portfolio diversification objectives, is exposed to risks posed by local political and economic conditions, as well as those resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our investment portfolios in the countries in the table below are currently the most affected by these conditions. The following table presents a summary of selected country fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value. The information below is presented on a “country of risk basis” (e.g. where the issuer primarily conducts business).
In the second quarter of 2020, Argentina defaulted on its foreign currency denominated sovereign fixed maturity securities. In the third quarter of 2020, Argentina exchanged new sovereign fixed maturity securities for substantially all of its defaulted foreign currency denominated sovereign fixed maturity securities. As a result of the economic conditions prior to the default, the Company impaired its holdings of such securities initially in the fourth quarter of 2019 and then, in the first quarter of 2020, recorded an ACL. Through June 30, 2020, the prior impairment and ACL on the defaulted securities totaled $155 million. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company exchanged securities with a par value and amortized cost net of ACL of $361 million and $146 million, respectively, plus accrued investment income of $11 million, for new securities with an estimated fair value of $182 million which resulted in a net gain of $25 million recorded in net investment gain (loss). In connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro in October 2020, the Company reduced its exposure to Argentina sovereign fixed maturity securities, as the assets disposed included $132 million of such securities at amortized cost. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.","See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.”

Item 7,Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments - Overview,"On January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit loss guidance. See “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments.” For our mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases, this new credit loss guidance requires that we incorporate the impact of both current and forecasted economic conditions and estimate expected lifetime credit loss in determining the ACL. Upon adoption of this new credit loss guidance, our ACL reflected the then current and forecasted economic conditions and our estimate of expected lifetime credit loss. Subsequently, we incorporated the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic into our economic forecast, using available information, to reflect our best estimate, in determining the level of our ACL for mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases.
Upon adoption of the new credit loss guidance, we increased our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments by $141 million, or 40%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments by another $150 million, or 42%. Our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments totaled $643 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 82% from December 31, 2019. In accordance with this new credit loss guidance, an ACL is recorded for fixed maturity securities AFS for the amount of the credit loss instead of recording a reduction of the amortized cost as an impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an ACL for our fixed maturity securities AFS of $81 million. As a result, our total investments-related ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments totaled $724 million at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a charge for provisions for credit loss and impairments of $488 million, prior to the release of the ACL for securities subsequently sold or exchanged of $133 million. In addition, there was an additional $11 million decrease in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro.
The determination of the amount of our ACL and impairments on our investment portfolio is highly subjective. Our ACL is revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Provisions for credit loss and impairments recognized in future quarters on our investment portfolio will depend primarily on future economic fundamentals, including the evolving impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, performance of our issuers, borrowers, tenants and lessees, changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation and changes in estimated fair value. In upcoming periods, if there are changes in the above factors, provisions for credit loss and impairments may be recorded, as well as changes in the ACL for which a provision for credit loss was previously recorded.","On January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit loss guidance.

Item 7A,Risk Management,"We have an integrated process for managing risk, which we conduct through multiple Board and senior management committees (financial and non-financial) across the Global Risk Management, ALM, Finance, Treasury, Investments and business segment departments. The risk committee structure is designed to provide a consolidated enterprise-wide assessment and management of risk. The ERC is responsible for reviewing all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions, if necessary, in the event risks exceed desired tolerances, taking into consideration industry best practices and the current environment to resolve or mitigate those risks. Additional committees at the MetLife, Inc. and subsidiary company level manage capital and risk positions and establish corporate business standards.","We have an integrated process for managing risk, which we conduct through multiple Board and senior management committees (financial and non-financial) across the Global Risk Management, ALM, Finance, Treasury, Investments and business segment departments.

Item 7A,Global Risk Management,"Independent from the lines of business, the centralized Global Risk Management department, led by the CRO, coordinates across all committees to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, measured, aggregated, managed and reported across the Company. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and is primarily responsible for maintaining and communicating the Company’s enterprise risk policies and for monitoring and analyzing all material risks.

Item 7A,Asset/Liability Management,"We actively manage our assets using an approach that is liability driven and balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The ALM process is the shared responsibility of the ALM, Global Risk Management, and Investments departments, with the engagement of senior members of the business segments and Finance, and is governed by the ALM Committees. The ALM Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving investment guidelines and limits, approving significant portfolio and ALM strategies and providing oversight of the ALM process. The directives of the ALM Committees are carried out and monitored through ALM Working Groups which are set up to manage risk by geography, product or portfolio type. The ALM Steering Committee oversees the activities of the underlying ALM Committees and Working Groups. The ALM Steering Committee reports to the ERC.
We establish portfolio guidelines that define ranges and limits related to asset allocation, interest rate risk, liquidity, concentration and other risks for each major business segment, legal entity or insurance product group. These guidelines support implementation of investment strategies used to adequately fund our liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. We also establish hedging programs and associated investment portfolios for different blocks of business. The ALM Working Groups monitor these strategies and programs through regular review of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, value at risk, market sensitivities (to interest rates, equity market levels, equity volatility, and foreign currency exchange rates), stress scenario payoffs, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.","We actively manage our assets using an approach that is liability driven and balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration and investment return.

Item 7A,Interest Rates,"Our exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from our holdings of fixed maturity securities and derivatives, as well as our interest rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities AFS include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and ABS, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts, and embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term interest rates) as fixed maturity securities AFS. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure exclude a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”","The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts, and embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term interest rates) as fixed maturity securities AFS.

Item 7A,Foreign Currency Exchange Rates,"Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from our holdings in non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through our investments in foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency exchange rate liabilities for purposes of this disclosure exclude a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts. The principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in our investment portfolios and liabilities are the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Selectively, we use U.S. dollar assets to support certain long-duration foreign currency liabilities. Through our investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, we are primarily exposed to the Japanese yen, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Korean won. In addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps, forwards and options, local surplus in some countries may be held entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets, which further minimize exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. We have matched much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”","The foreign currency exchange rate liabilities for purposes of this disclosure exclude a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts.

Item 7A,Interest Rate Risk Management,"To manage interest rate risk, we analyze interest rate risk using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivatives. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in-force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The NYDFS regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves. For several of our legal entities, we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of ALM and the allocation of investment income to product lines. In the U.S., for each segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities net of certain non-invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess allocated to Corporate & Other. The business segments may reflect differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. We measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models. These models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality, morbidity and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and defaults.
We employ product design, pricing and ALM strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products. ALM strategies include the use of derivatives. We also use reinsurance to mitigate interest rate risk.
We also use common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the duration of liabilities, we consider all policyholder guarantees and how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends. Each asset portfolio or portfolio group has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies.","The NYDFS regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves.

Item 7A,Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management,"MetLife has a well-established policy to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures within its risk tolerance. In general, investments backing specific liabilities are currency matched. This is achieved through direct investments in matching currency or through the use of foreign currency exchange derivatives. Enterprise foreign currency exchange rate risk limits are established by the ERC. Management of each of our segments, with oversight from our FX Working Group and the ALM committee for the respective segment, is responsible for managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure.
We use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products.","MetLife has a well-established policy to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures within its risk tolerance. In general, investments backing specific liabilities are currency matched."
Item 7A,Hedging Activities,"We use derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and equity market risk. Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on financial results under different accounting regimes, including U.S. GAAP and local statutory accounting. Our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. Our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows: Risks Related to Guarantee Benefits — We use a wide range of derivative contracts to mitigate the risk associated with living guarantee benefits. These derivatives include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options, TRRs, interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps. Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees — For certain liability contracts, we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. We purchase interest rate caps and floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees.Reinvestment Risk in Long-Duration Liability Contracts — Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long-duration liability contracts. Hedges include interest rate swaps, swaptions and Treasury bond forwards. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk — We use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. These hedges are generally used to swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to U.S. dollars. Our foreign subsidiaries also use these hedges to swap non-local currency assets to local currency, to match liabilities.General ALM Hedging Strategies — In the ordinary course of managing our asset/liability risks, we use interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and inflation swaps. These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows. Macro Hedge Program — We use equity options, equity TRRs, interest rate swaptions and interest rate swaps to mitigate the potential loss of legal entity statutory capital under stress scenarios.","We use derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and equity market risk.

Item 7A,Risk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis,"We measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis. For purposes of this disclosure, a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts is excluded, as discussed further below. This analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices. We believe that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term. In performing the analysis summarized below, we used market rates at December 31, 2020. The sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures (interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market) relating to our assets and liabilities. We modeled the impact of changes (increases and decreases) in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities and present the results with the most adverse level of market risk impact to the Company for each of these market risk exposures as follows: the net present values of our interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates; estimated fair values of our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (appreciation or depreciation) in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies; and the estimated fair value of our equity market sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices. The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include:
•interest sensitive and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive liabilities do not include $223.8 billion, at carrying value, of insurance contracts. Management believes that the changes in the economic value of those contracts under changing interest rates and changing foreign currency exchange rates would offset a significant portion of the fair value changes of interest sensitive and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive assets;
•the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgage loans;
•sensitivities do not include the impact on asset or liability valuation of changes in market liquidity or changes in market credit spreads;
•foreign currency exchange rate risk is not isolated for certain embedded derivatives within host asset and liability contracts, as the risk on these instruments is reflected as equity;
•for the derivatives that qualify as hedges, and for certain other assets such as mortgage loans, the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values;
•the analysis excludes liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts, as well as real estate holdings, private equity and hedge fund holdings; and
•the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period.
Accordingly, we use such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of our management. Based on our analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and prices, we have determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market exposures.","For purposes of this disclosure, a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts is excluded, as discussed further below.

Item 8,Support Agreements,"MetLife, Inc. guarantees obligations arising from OTC-bilateral derivatives of MrB. MrB is exposed to various risks relating to their ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. MrB uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. Further, MrB’s derivatives are subject to industry standard netting agreements and collateral agreements that limit the unsecured portion of any open derivative position. On a net counterparty basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019, derivative transactions with positive mark-to-market values (in-the-money) were $366 million and $360 million, respectively, and derivative transactions with negative mark-to-market values (out-of-the-money) were $158 million and $197 million, respectively. To secure the obligations represented by the out-of-the-money transactions, MrB had provided collateral to its counterparties with an estimated fair value of $158 million and $196 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, unsecured derivative liabilities guaranteed by MetLife, Inc. were $0 and $1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
MetLife, Inc. also guarantees the obligations of certain of its subsidiaries under committed facilities with third-party banks.

Item 8,Guarantees,"In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific liabilities and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than $1 million to $329 million, with a cumulative maximum of $549 million, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments.
In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company’s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future.
The Company also has minimum fund yield requirements on certain pension funds. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future.
The Company’s recorded liabilities were $20 million and $6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.

Item 8,Insolvency Assessments,"Many jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers or those that may become impaired, insolvent or fail. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. In addition, certain jurisdictions have government owned or controlled organizations providing life, health and property and casualty insurance to their citizens, whose activities could place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.","Many jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers or those that may become impaired, insolvent or fail.

Item 8,Derivative Actions and Demands,"Shareholders, seeking to sue derivatively on behalf of MetLife, Inc., commenced three separate actions against certain current and former members of the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors and/or certain current and former officers of MetLife, Inc., alleging that, among other things, they breached their fiduciary and other duties to the Company. In Kates v. Kandarian, et al. (E.D.N.Y., filed January 18, 2019, transferred to D. Del. July 8, 2019) and Felt, et al. v. Grise, et al. (D. Del., filed April 29, 2019), plaintiffs allege that the defendants disseminated or approved public statements that failed to disclose that MetLife’s practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits were inadequate and that MetLife had inadequate internal control over financial reporting. In Lifschitz v. Kandarian, et al. (Del. Ch., filed June 19, 2019), plaintiff alleges that the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors knew or should have known that MetLife’s practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits were inadequate. Felt and Lifschitz have been consolidated in the Court of Chancery in Delaware under the caption In re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation. In all of these actions, plaintiffs allege that because of the defendants’ breaches of duty, MetLife, Inc. has incurred damage to its reputation and has suffered other unspecified damages. On August 17, 2020, the court dismissed the complaint in In re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation, and on September 8, 2020, the court dismissed the complaint in Kates. Plaintiffs in In re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation have filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware, and on October 8, 2020, plaintiffs in Kates filed a third amended complaint with the district court.
The MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors received six letters, dated March 28, 2018, May 11, 2018, July 16, 2018, December 20, 2018, February 5, 2019, and April 7, 2020, written on behalf of individual stockholders, demanding that MetLife, Inc. take action against current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and/or investigate, remediate, and recover damages allegedly suffered by the Company as a result of (i) the Company’s allegedly inadequate practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits, (ii) the Company’s allegedly inadequate internal controls over financial reporting and corporate governance practices and procedures, and (iii) the alleged dissemination of false or misleading information related to these issues. The MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors appointed a special committee to investigate the allegations set forth in these six letters.

Item 8,Asbestos-Related Claims,"MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the period from the 1920s through approximately the 1950s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.
Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied MLIC’s motions. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials.","Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos.

Item 1,OVERVIEW,"RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance. We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. (“Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.”), RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Ltd. (“RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S.”), RenaissanceRe Europe AG (“RREAG”), Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe Unlimited Company (“Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe”) and our Lloyd’s syndicate, RenaissanceRe Syndicate 1458 (“Syndicate 1458”). We also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures, including DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. (“DaVinci”), Top Layer Reinsurance Ltd. (“Top Layer Re”), Upsilon RFO Re Ltd. (“Upsilon RFO”) and Vermeer Reinsurance Ltd. (“Vermeer”). In addition, through RenaissanceRe Medici Fund Ltd. (“Medici”), we invest in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk.
We aspire to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital and our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles, and keeping our promises. Our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends, which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance, and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time. The principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income, investment income and fee income generated by our third-party capital management business.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance, and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we have cultivated strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of several initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products, and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business. We also pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit, which has responsibility for creating and managing our joint ventures and managed funds, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk, and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures or managed funds, or the acquisition of, or the investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies.
We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures and managed funds managed by our ventures unit, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures managed by our ventures unit.
To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, managed funds and underwriting platforms around the world. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures, managed funds and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through Syndicate 1458 and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Syndicate 1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses, and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate.
A meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. Our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these events. We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover, which primarily impact our Property segment, in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. Our Casualty and Specialty business, which represents approximately half of our gross written premiums annually, is an efficient use of capital that is generally less correlated with our Property business. It allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital. 
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations. We have created and managed, and continue to manage, multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may
create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.","We aspire to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital and our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term.

Item 1,CORPORATE STRATEGY,"We aspire to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital and our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. Our strategy for achieving these objectives, which is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture, is to operate an integrated system of what we believe are our three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and superior capital management. We believe all three competitive advantages are required to achieve our objectives, and we aim to seamlessly coordinate the delivery of these competitive advantages for the benefit of our shareholders, ceding insurers, brokers and investors in our joint ventures and managed funds.
We aim to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. We believe our modeling and technical expertise, our risk management products, and our track record of keeping our promises have made us a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We seek to offer stable, predictable and consistent risk-based pricing and a prompt turnaround on claims.
We aim to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive risk-adjusted return on utilized capital. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as Renaissance Exposure Management System (“REMS©”). We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company.
We aim to write as much attractively priced business as is accessible to us and then manage our capital accordingly. We generally look to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture and managed fund investors. In using joint ventures and managed funds, we aim to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base, develop fee income, generate profit commissions, diversify our portfolio, and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital providers. We also routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture and managed fund opportunities and strategic investments.
We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team, our integrated and flexible underwriting and operating platform, our significant financial strength, our strong relationships with brokers and customers, our commitment to superior service and our proprietary modeling technology. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited.","We aim to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as Renaissance Exposure Management System (“REMS©”). We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company. We generally look to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture and managed fund investors. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited."
Item 1,Managed Joint Ventures and Managed Funds,"We actively manage a number of joint ventures and managed funds which provide us with an additional presence in the market, enhance our client relationships and generate fee income and profit commissions. These joint ventures and managed funds allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base. Currently, our principal joint ventures and managed funds include DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Medici, Upsilon RFO, RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd. (“Upsilon Fund”) and Vermeer.
DaVinci was established in 2001 and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain casualty and specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis. In accordance with DaVinci’s underwriting guidelines, we principally seek to construct for DaVinci a portfolio of short-tail reinsurance risks written primarily alongside Renaissance Reinsurance and certain other operating subsidiaries. From time to time, Renaissance Reinsurance or certain other operating subsidiaries write business for, and then cede it to, DaVinci. Third-party investors subscribe for the majority of the shares of DaVinciRe Holdings Ltd. (“DaVinciRe”), DaVinci’s holding company. Renaissance Underwriting Managers, Ltd. (“RUM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe, acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for DaVinciRe in return for a management fee and performance based incentive fee. Our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe was 21.4% at December 31, 2020 (2019 - 21.9%).
Top Layer Re was established in 1999 and writes high excess non-U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance. Top Layer Re is owned 50% by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”) and 50% by Renaissance Reinsurance. State Farm provides $3.9 billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to Top Layer Re. Top Layer Re is managed by RUM in return for a management fee.
Medici is an exempted fund that was incorporated in Bermuda in 2009. Medici’s objective is to invest substantially all of its assets in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily correlated to property catastrophe risk. Third-party investors subscribe for the majority of the participating, non-voting common shares of Medici. Medici is managed by RenaissanceRe Fund Management Ltd. (“RFM”) in return for a management fee. Our economic ownership in Medici was 15.7% at December 31, 2020 (2019 - 12.1%).
In 2013, we formed a managed fund, Upsilon RFO, a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer (“SPI”), principally to provide additional capacity to the worldwide aggregate and per-occurrence primary and retrocessional property catastrophe excess of loss market. Upsilon RFO enhances our efforts to match desirable reinsurance risk with efficient capital through a strategic capital structure. Original business is written directly by Upsilon RFO under fully-collateralized reinsurance contracts capitalized through the sale of non-voting shares to us and Upsilon Fund, or, to a lesser extent, is written directly by Renaissance Reinsurance and then ceded to Upsilon RFO. As a segregated accounts company, Upsilon RFO is permitted to establish segregated accounts to invest in and hold identified pools of assets and liabilities. Each pool of assets and liabilities in each segregated account is ring-fenced from any claims from the creditors of Upsilon RFO’s general account and from the creditors of other segregated accounts within Upsilon RFO.
We incorporated Upsilon Fund, an exempted Bermuda limited segregated accounts company, in 2014. Upsilon Fund was formed to provide a fund structure through which third-party investors can invest in property reinsurance risk managed by us. Third-party investors purchase redeemable, non-voting preference shares linked to specific segregated accounts of Upsilon Fund and own 100% of these shares. Upsilon Fund is managed by RFM in return for a management fee and performance based incentive fee. Currently, Upsilon Fund is invested in specific segregated accounts of Upsilon RFO.
Vermeer In 2018, we formed Vermeer, an exempted Bermuda reinsurer, with PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V. (“PGGM”), a Dutch pension fund manager. Vermeer provides capacity focused on risk remote layers in the U.S. property catastrophe market. Vermeer is managed by RUM in return for a management fee. We maintain majority voting control of Vermeer, while Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn, a pension fund represented by PGGM, retains economic benefits.

Item 1,Strategic Investments,"Our ventures unit also pursues strategic investments where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with
other market participants. These investments may be directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance, and at times may also be directed
at non-insurance risks, such as Insurtech opportunities. We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they
provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market. For example, in 2018 we acquired a minority
shareholding in Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd, a long-term consolidator in the non-life insurance/reinsurance run-off sector, which is accounted for at
fair value and is included in other investments. Other examples of strategic investments include our investments in a group of Tower Hill affiliated
companies including Bluegrass Insurance Management, LLC, Tower Hill Claims Service, LLC, Tower Hill Holdings, Inc., Tower Hill Insurance Group, LLC,
Tower Hill Insurance Managers, LLC, Tower Hill Re Holdings, Inc., Tower Hill Signature Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Tomoka Re Holdings, Inc.
(collectively, the “Tower Hill Companies”), which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also have investments in Essent Group
Ltd. and Trupanion Inc., which are accounted for at fair value and are included in equity investments trading.
The carrying value of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet, individually or in the aggregate, may differ from the realized value we may
ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so. For example, we believe that our investments in the Tower Hill Companies, which are recorded under the
equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”),
would attract a significantly higher valuation than what is currently recognized in our consolidated financial statements. However, under GAAP, we are
prohibited from recording these investments at fair value. In addition, there is no liquid market for these investments.","For example, in 2018 we acquired a minority

Item 1,Other transactions,"Our ventures unit works on a range of other customized reinsurance and financing transactions. For example, we have participated in and continuously
analyze other attractive opportunities in the market for insurance-linked securities and derivatives. We believe our products contain a number of
customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners, as well as our risk management objectives.","For example, we have participated in and continuously
analyze other attractive opportunities in the market for insurance-linked securities and derivatives."
Item 1,NEW BUSINESS,"From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures and managed funds, or
the acquisition of or investment in other companies or books of business of other companies. This potential diversification includes opportunities to write
targeted, additional classes of risk-exposed business, both directly for our own account and through new joint venture opportunities. We also regularly
evaluate potential strategic opportunities we believe might utilize our skills, capabilities, proprietary technology and relationships to support possible
expansion into further risk-related coverages, services and products. Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably
sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage.
We regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business, enhance or focus our strategies, expand our distribution
or capabilities, or provide other benefits. In evaluating potential new ventures or investments, we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity,
the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage, and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core operations. We believe
that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities
and track record of our ventures unit.","This potential diversification includes opportunities to write

Item 1,COMPETITION,"The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we believe that competition is, in general, increasing and becoming more robust. Our
competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries and/or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies,
reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies, domestic and international underwriting operations, and a range of entities offering forms of risk
transfer protection on a collateralized or other non-traditional basis. As our business evolves and the (re)insurance industry continues to experience
consolidation, we expect our competitors to change as well. For example, we may face competition from non-traditional competitors, such as
technology or Insurtech companies, among others.
We believe that our principal competitors include other companies active in the market, currently including Aeolus Re Ltd., Allied World Assurance
Company, AG, AlphaCat Managers (a part of American International Group Inc.), Arch Capital Group Ltd., Argo Group, Ark Insurance Holdings Ltd.,
Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXA XL, Axis Capital Holdings Limited, Chubb Limited, Conduit Holdings Limited, Convex Re Limited, Core Specialty
Insurance Holdings, Inc., Credit Suisse Insurance Linked Strategies, Elementum Advisors, LLC, Everest Re Group, Ltd., Fermat Capital Management,
LLC, Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., Hudson Structured Capital Management, James River Insurance
Company, Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP, LGTCapital Partners Ltd., Nephila Capital Ltd. (a part of Markel Corporation), Odyssey Re Holdings Corp.,
PartnerRe Ltd., Pillar Capital Management Limited, Securis Investment Partners LLC, Sompo International, Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., Transatlantic
Reinsurance Company (a part of Alleghany Corporation), Validus Reinsurance Ltd. (a part of American International Group Inc.) and Watford Re Ltd., as
well as a growing number of private, unrated reinsurers offering predominately collateralized reinsurance. We also compete with certain Lloyd’s
syndicates active in the London market, such as those managed by Beazley PLC, Hiscox Ltd., and Lancashire Holdings, as well as with a number of
other industry participants, such as American International Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Hannover Rückversicherung AG, Ironshore Inc., Münchener
Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München and Swiss Re Ltd. Hedge funds, pension funds and endowments, investment banks,
investment managers (such as Aeolus Re Ltd., AlphaCat Managers, Credit Suisse Insurance Linked Strategies, Fermat Capital Management, LLC,
Elementum Advisors, LLC, Leadenhall Capital Partners, LGTCapital Partners Ltd., Nephila Capital Ltd., a part of Markel Corporation, Securis Investment
Partners LLC), exchanges and other capital market participants are active in the reinsurance market and the market for related risk, either through the
formation of reinsurance companies (such as Aeolus Re Ltd., Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., The D.
E. ShawGroup and Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.) or through the use of other financial products, such as catastrophe bonds, other insurance-linked
securities and collateralized reinsurance investment funds. We expect competition from these sources to increase. In addition, we continue to anticipate
growth in financial products offered to the insurance market that are intended to compete with traditional reinsurance, such as insurance-linked securities
(including catastrophe bonds), unrated privately held reinsurance companies providing collateralized or other non-traditional reinsurance, catastrophe-
linked derivative agreements and other financial products.
The tax policies of the countries where our customers operate, as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds, also affect demand for
reinsurance, sometimes significantly. Moreover, government-backed entities may represent competition for the coverages we provide directly or for the
business of our customers, reducing the potential amount of third-party private protection our clients might need or desire.","The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we believe that competition is, in general, increasing and becoming more robust.

Item 1,Underwriting,"Our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on
shareholders’ equity, subject to prudent risk constraints, and to generate long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in
accumulated dividends. We assess each new (re)insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental
contribution to portfolio risk.
We have developed a proprietary, computer-based pricing and exposure management system, REMS©, which has analytic and modeling capabilities
that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental (re)insurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of (re)insurance contracts. We
believe that REMS© is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and
culture. In conjunction with pricing models that we run outside of REMS©, the REMS© framework encompasses and facilitates risk capture, analysis,
correlation, portfolio aggregation and capital allocation within a single system for all of our natural and non-natural hazards (re)insurance contracts. We
continue to invest in and improve REMS©, incorporating our underwriting and modeling experience and adding proprietary software and a significant
amount of new industry data. We continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural and non-natural hazard models in REMS© and
while our experience is most developed for analyzing natural hazard catastrophe risks, we continue to invest in and evolve our capabilities for assessing
non-natural hazard catastrophe risks. Over the last ten years, we have continued to develop our casualty and specialty modeling tools and capabilities in
line with our business needs. With the acquisitions of Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd. (“Platinum”) and Tokio Millennium Re AG and certain
associated entities and subsidiaries (collectively, “TMR”), and the expertise and tools added throughout this period, we believe our tools are state of the
art and fully embedded in our underwriting processes.
We generally utilize a multiple model approach when evaluating a proposed transaction, combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques. We
combine the analyses generated by REMS© with other information and other model inputs available to us, including our own knowledge of the client
submitting the proposed program, to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of utilized capital which the program presents. The
underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and REMS© framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available
models. We use commercially available natural hazard catastrophe models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and REMS©
results.
Before we bind a (re)insurance risk, exposure data, historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers. Using a combination of
proprietary software, underwriting experience, actuarial techniques and engineering expertise, the exposure data is reviewed and augmented, as we
deem appropriate. We use this data as primary inputs into the REMS© modeling system as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk
being evaluated. We believe that the REMS© modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis, assisting our determination of
what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk to be assumed. In part, through the process described above
and the utilization of REMS©, we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital we notionally
allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks. A key advantage of our REMS© framework is our ability to
include additional perils, risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in commercially available natural hazards risk models. For instance, we
believe that we are able to incorporate the risk of an increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes due to climate change in our models
more comprehensively than commercially available models.
We periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in REMS© and our other tools, driven either by new hazard science and
understanding or by experience of loss events. For example, the movement in cedant loss estimates seen across the market in the months following
Hurricane Irma prompted us to perform, in conjunction with several partner companies, a detailed review of the nature of the claims made as a result of
that and subsequent events. We have reviewed the prevalence of ""assignment of benefits,"" or ""AOB,"" activity in underlying claims, as well as the impact
of loss adjusting expenses and the costs associated with any litigation (often called social inflation), and this process has informed a change in our view 
of reinsurance risk in certain parts of the state of Florida based on observed behavioral norms. More generally our team of scientists at RenaissanceRe 
Risk Sciences Inc. have been tracking the impact of climate change and expanding urban development in both tornado/hail and wildfire risk over the 
last several years. The recent history of California wildfire events, and particularly the extreme outbreaks during 2017 and 2018,are being used to validate, 
and where necessary inform, our representation of this risk.
Our underwriters use the combination of our risk assessment and underwriting process, REMS© and other tools in their pricing decisions, which we
believe provides them with several competitive advantages. These include the ability to: simulate a range of potential outcomes that adequately represents 
the risk to an individual contract; analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio; better assess the underlying 
exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business; price contracts within a short time frame; capture various classes of risk, including 
catastrophe and other insurance risks; assess risk across multiple entities (including our various joint ventures and managed funds) and across different 
components of our capital structure; and provide consistent pricing information. As part of our risk management process, we also use REMS© to assist 
us, as a retrocedant, with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account.
Our underwriting and risk management process, in conjunction with REMS©, quantifies and manages our exposure to claims from single events and the
exposure to losses from a series of events. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we also assess a variety of other factors, including:
the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedant;
the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share;
historical loss data for the cedant and, where available, for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions and lines of business, in order to
compare the cedant’s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages;
the cedant’s pricing strategies; and
the perceived financial strength of the cedant and factors such as the cedant’s historical record of making premium payments in full and on a
timely basis.
In order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non-natural hazard reinsurance (i.e., our casualty and specialty lines of business), we establish
probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio. In lines with catastrophe risk, such as excess workers’ compensation
and terrorism, we seek to directly leverage our skill in modeling property reinsurance risks, and aim to appropriately estimate and manage the
correlations between these casualty and specialty lines and our property reinsurance portfolio. For other classes of business, in which we believe we
have little or no natural catastrophe exposure, and therefore less correlation with our property reinsurance coverages, we derive probability distributions
from a variety of underlying information sources, including recent historical experience, and the application of judgment as appropriate. The nature of
some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis we use for our property reinsurance coverages, reflecting both the nature of available exposure
information, and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure. We produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related
underlying risks which our products cover, which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio.
In addition, we also produce, utilize, and report on models which measure our utilization of capital in light of regulatory capital considerations and
constraints. Our position in respect of these regulatory capital models is reviewed by our risk management professional staff and periodically reported to
and reviewed by senior underwriting personnel and executive management with responsibility for our regulated operating entities.","Our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on

Item 1,Enterprise Risk Management,"We believe that high-quality and effective Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the
organization and consider ERM to be a key process which is the responsibility of every individual within the Company. We have developed and utilize
tools and processes we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. We believe that our
ERM processes and practices help us to identify potential events that may affect us, quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed,
and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives. We believe that effective ERM can provide us with a significant
competitive advantage. We also believe that effective ERM assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the
ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments, underwriting decisions, or other operating or business activities, although we do not
believe this risk can be eliminated. We believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify
opportunities we believe to be the most attractive. In particular, we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital and
liquidity positions, on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries, and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support
the risks we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries. We believe that our risk management efforts are essential
to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long-term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our
shareholders.
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing enterprise-wide risk management and is actively involved in the monitoring of risks that could affect
us. The members of the Board have regular, direct access to the senior executives and other officers responsible for identifying and monitoring our risks
and coordinating our ERM, including our Group Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Group General Counsel, each of whom reports directly to
our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other senior personnel such as our Chief Investment Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer,
Global Corporate Controller and Head of Internal Audit. The Board also receives regular reports from the Controls and Compliance Committee described
below.
Our ERM framework operates via a three lines of defense model. The first line of defense consists of individual functions that deliberately assume risks
on our behalf and own and manage risk within the Company on a day-to-day and business operational basis. The second line of defense is responsible
for risk oversight and also supports the first line to understand and manage risk. A dedicated risk team led by the Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible
for this second line and reports to the Board of Director’s Investment and Risk Management Committee and the Chief Executive Officer. The third line of
defense, our Internal Audit team, reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and provides independent, objective assurance as to the
assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems and also coordinates risk-based audits and compliance reviews and other
specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business.
The principal risk areas that make up our ERM framework are assumed risk (including reserve risk), business environment risk and operational risk:
Assumed Risk. We define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against our capital base, including underwriting risks and
other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and market risk as they relate to investments, ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment
risk, each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques. Of these, we believe underwriting risk to be the
most material to us. In order to understand, monitor, quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk, we seek to develop and deploy
appropriate tools to estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities and the impact that such incremental
business could have on our overall risk profile. We use the tools and methods described above in “Underwriting” to seek to achieve these
objectives. Embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of our aggregate, consolidated risk profile. In part through the
utilization of REMS© and our other systems and procedures, we analyze our in-force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis. We
believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures and to rigorously analyze and evaluate individual proposed transactions in
the context of our in-force portfolio. This aggregation process captures line of business, segment and corporate risk profiles, calculates internal
and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance. Generally, additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to 
reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk, credit risk, capital adequacy and liquidity. This information 
is used in day-to-day decision making for underwriting, investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and 
consolidated financial position perspective. We also regularly assess, monitor and review our regulatory risk capital and related constraints.
Reserve Risk. Reserve risk is a subcomponent of assumed risk. We define reserve risk as the risks related to our reserve for net claims and
claim expenses, including the amount, both absolute and relative, of our outstanding reserve for net claims and claim expenses, and the impact
of economic, social, legal and regulatory matters. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty and has
the potential to develop adversely in future periods. While reserve risk may increase in both absolute terms and relative to its overall
consideration in our ERM framework, we employ robust resources, procedures and technology to identify, understand, quantify and manage this
risk. Our reserving methodologies and sensitivities for each respective line of business described in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense
Reserves.”
Business Environment Risk. We define business environment risk as the risk of changes in the business, political or regulatory environment that
could negatively impact our short term or long-term financial results or the markets in which we operate. This risk area also typically includes
emerging risks. These risks are predominately extrinsic to us and our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited, so we focus our efforts
on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the
consequences of, and ensure compliance with, any new requirements applicable to us.
Operational Risk. We are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational, regulatory, and other matters. We define operational
risk to include the risk we fail to create, manage, control or mitigate the people, processes, structures or functions required to execute our
strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk, and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of
business environment risk applicable to us. In light of the rapid evolution of our markets, business environment, and business initiatives, we seek
to continually invest in the tools, processes and procedures we use to mitigate our exposure to operational risk on a cost-effective basis. As
with assumed risk and business environment risk, operational risk presents intrinsic uncertainties, and we may fail to appropriately identify or
mitigate applicable operational risk.
Controls and Compliance Committee. We believe that a key component of our current operational risk management platform is our Controls and
Compliance Committee. The Controls and Compliance Committee is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel, Chief Compliance
Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit, staff compliance and controls
professionals and representatives from our other business units. The purpose of the Controls and Compliance Committee is to establish, assess the
effectiveness of, and enforce policies, procedures and practices relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, regulatory, legal, compliance
and related matters, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Code of Ethics and Conduct (the “Code of Ethics”), and other
relevant standards. In addition, the Controls and Compliance Committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially raise complex
and/or significant tax, legal, accounting, regulatory, financial reporting, reputational or compliance issues.
We address other areas of operational risk through our disaster recovery program, human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent,
our strict tax protocols and our legal and regulatory policies and procedures.
Ongoing Development and Enhancement. We seek to reflect and categorize risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions, even where
we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks, such as
catastrophe and market risks. We also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks and believe effective risk management is a continual
process that requires ongoing improvement and development. We seek from time to time to identify effective new practices or additional developments
both from within our industry and from other sectors. We believe that our ongoing efforts to embed ERM throughout our organization help us produce and 
maintain a competitive advantage and achieve our corporate goals.
","We have developed and utilize
tools and processes we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. We believe that effective ERM can provide us with a significant
competitive advantage. We believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify
opportunities we believe to be the most attractive. We believe that our risk management efforts are essential
to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long-term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our
shareholders. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing enterprise-wide risk management and is actively involved in the monitoring of risks that could affect
us. The members of the Board have regular, direct access to the senior executives and other officers responsible for identifying and monitoring our risks
and coordinating our ERM, including our Group Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Group General Counsel, each of whom reports directly to
our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other senior personnel such as our Chief Investment Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer,
Global Corporate Controller and Head of Internal Audit. The Board also receives regular reports from the Controls and Compliance Committee described
below. Our ERM framework operates via a three lines of defense model. A dedicated risk team led by the Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible
for this second line and reports to the Board of Director’s Investment and Risk Management Committee and the Chief Executive Officer. We define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against our capital base, including underwriting risks and
other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and market risk as they relate to investments, ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment
risk, each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques. We
believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures and to rigorously analyze and evaluate individual proposed transactions in
the context of our in-force portfolio. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty and has
the potential to develop adversely in future periods. While reserve risk may increase in both absolute terms and relative to its overall
consideration in our ERM framework, we employ robust resources, procedures and technology to identify, understand, quantify and manage this
risk. Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense
Reserves.”
Business Environment Risk. We define business environment risk as the risk of changes in the business, political or regulatory environment that
could negatively impact our short term or long-term financial results or the markets in which we operate. This risk area also typically includes
emerging risks. These risks are predominately extrinsic to us and our ability to alter or eliminate these risks is limited, so we focus our efforts
on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the
consequences of, and ensure compliance with, any new requirements applicable to us. Controls and Compliance Committee. The purpose of the Controls and Compliance Committee is to establish, assess the
effectiveness of, and enforce policies, procedures and practices relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, regulatory, legal, compliance
and related matters, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Code of Ethics and Conduct (the “Code of Ethics”), and other
relevant standards. We also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks and believe effective risk management is a continual
process that requires ongoing improvement and development. We believe that our ongoing efforts to embed ERM throughout our organization help us produce and 
maintain a competitive advantage and achieve our corporate goals."
Item 1,ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS,"Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe, and believe the consensus view of
current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, have increased, and
are likely to continue to increase, the severity and frequency of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience
over the past 100 years. While it is difficult to distinguish between permanent climate change and transient climate variability, an ever expanding body of
research suggests that these trends are in fact man-made, and, if correct, we believe that this trend will not revert to the mean but continue to worsen. 
We believe that this increase in severe weather, coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to
factors that will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in
general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. Accordingly, we expect an increase in
both the frequency and magnitude of claims, especially from properties located in coastal areas.
The consideration of the impacts of climate change is integral to our ERM process. We have taken measures to mitigate losses related to climate
change through our underwriting process and by continuously monitoring and adjusting our risk management models to reflect the higher level of risk that
we think will persist.
As discussed further below under “—Investments,” we structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of
liquidity to meet our claims obligations and to be well diversified across market sectors and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted
basis over time. To further the sustainability of our investment portfolio, we consider certain environmental, social and governance factors within our
investment strategy.
In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, there has been a proliferation of governmental and regulatory scrutiny
related to climate change and greenhouse gases, which will also affect our business. Many of our regulators are increasingly focused on climate change
disclosures, for example, the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “NYDFS”) has issued guidance indicating that insurers should start
integrating the consideration of the financial risk of climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, and business
strategies.","We believe, and believe the consensus view of
current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, have increased, and

Item 1,RATINGS,"Financial strength ratings are an important factor in evaluating and establishing the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies. We
have received high claims-paying and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), Standard and Poor’s Rating Services
(“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch”). These ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer’s financial
strength, operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations, and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our principal operating
subsidiaries and joint ventures and ratings may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them.
In addition, S&P and A.M. Best assess companies’ ERM practices, which is an opinion on the many critical dimensions of risk that determine overall
creditworthiness. RenaissanceRe has been assigned an ERM rating of “Very Strong” from each of these agencies, which is the highest ERM score
assigned.
See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Ratings” for the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment, and details of recent ratings actions.","Financial strength ratings are an important factor in evaluating and establishing the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies.

Item 1,RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CAIM EXPENSES,"We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim
expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and 
administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. We establish our claims and 
claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies, but which have not yet been paid (“case reserves”), adding 
estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us, or incurred but not enough reported to us (collectively referred to as “IBNR”) 
and, if deemed necessary, adding costs for additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts which we 
believe may not be adequately estimated by the client as of that date, or adequately covered in the application of IBNR. Our reserving committee, which 
includes members of our senior management, reviews, discusses, and assesses the reasonableness and adequacy of the reserving estimates included in 
our audited financial statements. Because of the nature of the coverages that we provide, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our 
policy liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps significantly, and,therefore, are highly uncertain.
Our reserving techniques, assumptions and processes differ among our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. Refer to “Note 8. Reserve for
Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the
reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year development of the reserve for
claims and claim expenses, analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each of our Property and Casualty
and Specialty segments. In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” for more information on our current estimates versus our initial
estimates of our claims reserves, and sensitivity analysis for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments.","Claims and claim

Item 1,INVESTMENTS,"We structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet our claims obligations and to be well
diversified across market sectors and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. The majority of our investments consists
of highly-rated fixed income securities. We also hold a significant amount of short-term investments which have a maturity of one year or less when
purchased. In addition, we hold other investments, including private equity investments, catastrophe bonds, private credit investments, senior secured
bank loan funds, hedge funds and certain equity securities, which offer the potential for higher returns but with relatively higher levels of risk. Our
investment portfolio takes into account the duration of our liabilities and the level of strategic asset risk we wish to assume over the medium- to long-
term. We may from time to time re-evaluate our investment guidelines and explore investment allocations to other asset classes that either increase or
decrease our overall asset risk. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities.
For additional information regarding our investment portfolio, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investments” and “Note 5. Investments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated

Item 1,MARKETING,"We believe that our modeling and technical expertise, the risk management products we provide to our customers, and our reputation for paying claims
promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We market our products primarily
through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and partners. We believe that our existing portfolio of business is a
valuable asset and, therefore, we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers. We believe that by maintaining
close relationships with brokers, we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds. We target prospects that are capable of
supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business.
We believe that primary insurers’ and brokers’ willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing, but also on the financial security of
the reinsurer, its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims, the quality of a reinsurer’s service, the
reinsurer’s willingness and ability to design customized programs, its long-term stability and its commitment to provide stable reinsurance capacity
across market cycles. We believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions, 
for fast payments on valid claims and for providing creative solutions to our customers’ needs.
Our portfolio of business continues to be characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business, although no
current relationship exceeds 10% of our gross premiums written. Accordingly, our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations
depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these customers. We believe that our willingness and ability to design
customized programs and to provide bespoke risk management products has helped us to develop long-term relationships with brokers and customers.
Our brokers assess client needs and also perform data collection, contract preparation and other administrative tasks, enabling us to market our
products cost effectively. Our distribution is reliant on a small number of broker relationships, which has continued to decrease in recent years as a
result of consolidation in the broker sector. We expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase. For example, in March 2020, AON plc and
Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company announced they had agreed to merge, with the deal expected to close in 2021. In 2020, three brokerage
firms accounted for 79.6% of our gross premiums written.
The following table shows the percentage of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments’ gross premiums written generated through subsidiaries
and affiliates of our largest brokers:","We market our products primarily

Item 1,Our Culture and Human Capital Resources Oversight,"At RenaissanceRe, our people are our most valuable resource and are core to our success. We believe in fostering an open and collaborative culture that
encourages employees to take ownership of their performance and development. Our executive management team is committed to creating an
environment where every person on our team can succeed. The Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is actively
engaged in the oversight of these initiatives and receives regular updates from management on progress and developments, and our executive
management team and Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee receive regular reports on progress against our annual human resources
tactical plans.","We believe in fostering an open and collaborative culture that

Item 1,Our Employees,"We strive to hire talented people and invest heavily in their development to aid them in their professional and personal growth. As employees grow at
RenaissanceRe, we support them in mastering specific competencies at each career level, and we believe our Career Development Framework provides
all our employees with tools to facilitate career growth at RenaissanceRe. Our bespoke approach to development encourages continuous learning
through skills-based training, technical development and stretch assignments.
At February 1, 2021, we employed 604 people worldwide (February 3, 2020 - 566, February 4, 2019 - 411). Of these employees, 171 were located in
Bermuda, 145 in the U.S., 271 in Europe and 17 in the Asia-Pacific region.","As employees grow at

Item 1,Our Work Environment,"We endeavor to provide a safe, healthy and supportive work environment that promotes the well-being of our employees and the value that they contribute
to our global organization. We actively encourage open dialogue with our employees, and conduct regular surveys to measure employee satisfaction and
engagement, allowing us to ensure that lower-scoring areas are addressed and clear guidance and support is provided.
We have focused on our employees’ safety during the COVID-19 pandemic and have switched to a largely remote work paradigm in response to
government restrictions. Our Board of Directors and management team have focused on safety during the COVID-19 pandemic by, among other things,
establishing corporate, location-based policies and procedures, providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to employees,
and implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 exposures and cases. As appropriate, certain of our offices have opened on an
optional and limited basis in accordance with applicable rules and regulations in their respective jurisdictions. We believe that we have adjusted well to
date, benefiting from prior and enhanced investments in technology, systems and training, which have enabled us to maintain robust oversight of the
Company and keep our employees connected during the COVID-19 pandemic.","We actively encourage open dialogue with our employees, and conduct regular surveys to measure employee satisfaction and

Item 1,"Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) Initiatives","We believe that by seeking diversity, creating equity and practicing inclusion we will build an even stronger culture and company. Our cross-functional
DEI Executive Council chaired by our Chief Underwriting Officer sets our DEI strategy, identifying focus areas such as raising awareness of DEI
throughout our organization, enhancing our recruitment and selection process, and furthering equity around leadership opportunities and development.
Our DEI governance structure also includes local advisory committees responsible for implementation at a country level.","Our cross-functional

potential risks, while rewarding employees for pursuing our strategic and financial objectives through appropriate risk taking, risk management and
prudent tactical and strategic decision making. We strive to provide fair and living employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee
positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. We do this by performing regular market checks of our competitive pay programs
in each of our locations, as well as an annual pay cycle review where we assess each employee’s pay levels.","We design our compensation programs to incorporate a range of components that we believe help to attract and retain talented individuals and mitigate
potential risks, while rewarding employees for pursuing our strategic and financial objectives through appropriate risk taking, risk management and
prudent tactical and strategic decision making."
Item 1,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,"Our business and support functions utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers. We have an
integrated team of professionals who manage and support our communication platforms, transaction-management systems, and analytics and reporting
capabilities, including the development of proprietary solutions like REMS©. We use off-site, secure data centers in North America and Europe for most
of our core applications, but our use of cloud-based services is increasing as the security and reliability of these services improves.
Information security and privacy are important concerns, with an escalating cyber-threat environment and evolving regulatory requirements driving
continued investment in this area. Our information security program is designed to meet or exceed industry best practices. We are subject to a number
of cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations, such as the NYDFS 23 NYCRR 500 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services
Companies, and the EUGeneral Data Protection Regulation. New York’s cybersecurity regulation requires regulated entities, including Renaissance
Reinsurance U.S., a New York licensed insurer, and RenaissanceRe Europe AG, US Branch (“RREAG, US Branch”), to establish and maintain a
cybersecurity program designed to protect each of their information technology systems as well as their customers’ data. Our program is designed to
comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulatory requirements and we continue to evaluate and assess our compliance in the changing regulatory
environment.
We have in place, and seek to continuously improve, a comprehensive system of security controls, managed by a dedicated staff. Periodically, we
engage the services of reputable third parties to perform security penetration testing, and update our security controls based on any findings. In addition, we are subject to independent assessment and review by regulators, as well as an annual audit of our security controls by our independent internal audit team. We also provide regular security risk education awareness and training sessions for all staff. Despite these efforts, computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct, and other internal or external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions.
We have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity plans for our operations, which are regularly tested with respect to our business-critical
infrastructure and systems. We employ data backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are regularly backed up,
and can be restored promptly if, and as, needed. In addition, we generally store backup information at off-site locations, in order to seek to minimize our
risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster. Our recovery plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers and cloud infrastructure. We believe we will be able to utilize these plans to efficiently recover key system functionality in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due
to various scenarios, such as natural disasters.","We have an

Item 1,REGULATION,"The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries and all states in the U.S., although the degree and type of regulation varies
significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Currently, we operate through offices primarily in Australia, Bermuda, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the
U.S. and the U.K. Although principally regulated by the regulatory authorities of their respective jurisdictions, our operating subsidiaries may also be
subject to regulation in the jurisdictions of their ceding companies. In addition, expansion into additional insurance markets could expose us or our
subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight. However, we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that our
Bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct U.S. regulation.","The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries and all states in the U.S., although the degree and type of regulation varies

Item 1,Bermuda Regulation,"All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981. In addition, the Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations
(collectively, the “Insurance Act”), regulate the business of our Bermuda insurance, reinsurance and management company subsidiaries. As a holding
company, RenaissanceRe is not regulated as an insurer under the Insurance Act. However, the Insurance Act regulates the insurance and reinsurance
business of our Bermuda-licensed operating insurance companies. RenaissanceRe’s Bermuda-licensed operating insurance subsidiaries and joint
ventures include Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci, which are registered as Class 4 general business insurers, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S.,
Vermeer and RenaissanceRe Europe AG, Bermuda Branch (“RREAG, Bermuda Branch”), which are registered as Class 3B general business insurers,
Top Layer Re, which is registered as a Class 3A general business insurer under the Insurance Act, and Shima Reinsurance Ltd., which is registered as
a Class 3 general business insurer under the Insurance Act. RenaissanceRe also has operating subsidiaries registered as SPIs under the Insurance
Act, including Upsilon RFO. RUM and RenaissanceRe Underwriting Management Ltd. are each registered as insurance managers under the Insurance
Act. From time to time, RenaissanceRe’s Bermuda-licensed operating insurance subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and managed funds may apply
for, and be granted, certain modifications to, or exemptions from, regulatory requirements which may otherwise apply to them.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the Bermuda Monetary
Authority (the “BMA”) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.
The European Parliament recognizes Bermuda’s regulatory regime as achieving Solvency II equivalence for its commercial (re)insurers. Equivalence
between Bermuda's regulatory regime and the U.K.'s prudential regime has been automatically maintained following the expiry of the U.K.'s transition
period for leaving the EU on January 1, 2021.
General Purpose Financial Statements. All Class 3, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 general business insurers must prepare annual financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or other acceptable accounting standards, which are published on the BMA website. Accordingly, audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP for each of Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Vermeer and RREAG, Bermuda Branch must be filed with the BMA prior to April 30 of each year and are available free of charge on the BMA’s website.
Statutory Financial Statements. Each Class 3, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 general business insurer is generally required to submit annual statutory
financial statements to the BMA as part of its annual statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer’s financial year end (unless
specifically extended). The GAAP or IFRS financial statements are the basis on which statutory financial statements are prepared, subject to the
application of certain prudential filters as outlined in the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016. The statutory financial statements contain statements both on
a consolidated and unconsolidated basis. The unconsolidated information forms the basis for assessing the insurer’s liquidity position, minimum
solvency margin and class of registration.
Capital and Solvency Return. Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 general business insurers are also required to file, on an annual basis, a capital and solvency
return in respect of their general business, which currently includes, among other items, a statutory economic balance sheet (“EBS”), a schedule of risk
management, a catastrophe risk return, a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves (where applicable), a schedule of eligible capital
and the Enhanced Capital Requirement (“ECR”) as calculated by the Bermuda Solvency and Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) model (or an approved
internal model). The BSCR is a mathematical model designed to give the BMA robust methods for determining an insurer’s capital adequacy. Underlying
the BSCR is the belief that all insurers should operate on an ongoing basis with a view to maintaining their capital at a prudent level in excess of the
minimum solvency margin otherwise prescribed under the Insurance Act. The consolidated information within the statutory financial statements form the
starting basis for the preparation of the EBS. The EBS is, in turn, used as the basis to calculate the insurer’s ECR for the relevant year. The 2020 BSCR
must be filed with the BMA before April 30, 2021; at this time, we believe each company that is required to file will exceed the minimum amount required
to be maintained under Bermuda law.
Financial Condition Report. Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and publish a financial condition report
(“FCR”), which provides, among other things, details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework and solvency and
financial performance of the insurer/insurance group. We received approval from the BMA to file a consolidated group FCR, inclusive of DaVinci,
Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., Top Layer Re and Vermeer. In addition, we received approval from the BMA to file an FCR for
RREAG, in lieu of a standalone FCR for RREAG, Bermuda Branch. Our most recent FCRs were filed with the BMA prior to the June 30, 2020 deadline,
and are available on our website.
Minimum Solvency Margin. A general business insurer’s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount, equal to or greater than the
prescribed minimum solvency margin, which varies with the category of its registration. The minimum solvency margin that must be maintained by a
Class 4 insurer is the greater of (i) $100.0 million, (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross
premiums), (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the ECR, which is established by
reference to the BSCR model. The minimum solvency margin for a Class 3 insurer is the greater of (i) $1.0 million, (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net
premiums written; if in excess of $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, or (iii) 15% of net
aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves. The minimum solvency margin for a Class 3A or Class 3B insurer is the
greater of (i) $1.0 million, (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written; if in excess of $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net
premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the
insurer’s ECR for the relevant year.
Enhanced Capital Requirement. Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is required to maintain its available statutory economic capital and
surplus at a level at least equal to its ECR which is established by reference to either the BSCR or an approved internal capital model. In either case, the
ECR shall at all times equal or exceed the respective Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer’s minimum solvency margin and may be adjusted in
circumstances where the BMA concludes that the insurer’s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ECR or the insurer’s
assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ECR applicable to it. While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level for each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of the respective
ECR. While a Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory economic capital and surplus at this level, the
target capital level serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the target capital level will likely
result in increased BMA regulatory oversight.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio. An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio equal to the value of its relevant assets
at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities.
Eligible Capital. To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of an insurer’s capital resources, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must
maintain available capital in accordance with a “three tiered capital system.” All capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital,
which in turn are classified into one of three tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3) based on their ""loss absorbency"" characteristics. Eligibility limits are then
applied to each tier in determining the amounts eligible to cover regulatory capital requirement levels. The highest capital is classified as Tier 1 capital
and lesser quality capital is classified as either Tier 2 capital or Tier 3 capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1,
Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used to satisfy the Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers' minimum solvency margin, ECR requirements and target capital level.
Restrictions on Dividends, Distributions and Reductions of Capital. Class 3, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from declaring or
paying any dividends if in breach of the required minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio (the “Relevant Margins”) or if the declaration or
payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the Relevant Margins. Further, Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from
declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s
statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to
meet its Relevant Margins. Class 3, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of
the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year’s financial statements. These restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions
under the Insurance Act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the Companies Act 1981 which apply to all Bermuda companies.
Fit and Proper Controllers. The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers (as defined herein) of all Bermuda registered insurers. For so long as
shares of RenaissanceRe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) or another recognized stock exchange, the Insurance Act requires that
the BMA be notified in writing within 45 days of any person becoming, or ceasing to be, a controller. A controller includes the managing director or chief
executive of the registered insurer or its parent company; a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller; and any person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. In addition, all Bermuda insurers are also
required to give the BMA written notice of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45
days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer includes a director, secretary, chief executive or senior executive
performing the duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters by whatever name called.
Material Change. All registered insurers are required to give the BMA 30 days’ notice of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of
the Insurance Act, and shall not take any steps to give effect to a material change unless, before the end of notice period unless they have been notified
by the BMA in writing that it has no objection to such change or the period has lapsed without the BMA issuing a notice of objection.
Insurance Code of Conduct. All Bermuda insurers are required to comply with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct, which establishes duties,
requirements and standards to be complied with to ensure each insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls.
Failure to comply with these requirements will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in
a sound and prudent manner under the Insurance Act and in calculating the operational risk charge applicable in accordance with the insurer's BSCR
model (or an approved internal model).
Special Purpose Insurer Reporting Requirements. Unlike other (re)insurers, SPIs are fully funded to meet their (re)insurance obligations; therefore the
application and supervision processes are streamlined to facilitate the transparent structure. Further, the BMA has the discretion to modify such
insurer’s accounting requirements under the Insurance Act. Like other (re)insurers, the principal representative of an SPI has a duty to inform the BMA in
relation to solvency matters, where applicable. SPIs are generally required to prepare audited financial statements in accordance with GAAP or other
standards recognized by the BMA, as well as annual statutory financial statements, and file these statements with the BMA together with a statutory
financial return, which includes information around ownership structure, assessment of risks, analyses of premium, details of segregated cells, a
solvency certificate, and other information.
Insurance Manager Reporting Requirements. The BMA’s Insurance Manager Code of Conduct requires insurance managers to file an Insurance
Manager’s Return, which requires, among other things, details around directors and officers of the insurance manager, the services provided by the
entity, and details of the insurers managed by the insurance manager. Additionally, under the Insurance Act, insurance managers are required to notify
the BMA of certain events, such as a failure to comply with a condition imposed upon it by the BMA or the occurrence of a cyber reporting event.
Group Supervision. Pursuant to the Insurance Act, the BMA acts as the group supervisor of the RenaissanceRe group of companies (the
“RenaissanceRe Group”) and it has designated Renaissance Reinsurance to be the “designated insurer” in respect of the RenaissanceRe Group. The
designated insurer is required to ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group complies with the provisions of the Insurance Act pertaining to groups and all
related group solvency and group supervision rules. Under these rules, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to annually prepare and submit to the BMA
group GAAP financial statements, group statutory financial statements, a group capital and solvency return (including an EBS) and an FCR. An
insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group's assets exceeds the amount of the insurance group's liabilities by the aggregate of:
(i) the individual minimum solvency margin of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company; and (ii) the parent company’s
percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s minimum solvency margin, where the parent company exercises significant influence
over a member of the group but does not control the member (the ""Group Minimum Solvency Margin""). A member is a qualified member of the insurance
group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. Every insurance group is also required to submit an annual
group actuarial opinion when filing its group capital and solvency return. The group is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be the
group actuary. The group actuary must provide an opinion on the RenaissanceRe Group’s technical provisions as recorded in the RenaissanceRe Group
statutory EBS. Insurance groups are required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the
value of its group ECR, which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the BSCR model of the group (the “Group BSCR”) (or an
approved internal capital model) provided that the group ECR shall at all times be an amount equal to or exceeding the Group Minimum Solvency Margin.
The BMA expects insurance groups to operate at or above a group target capital level, which exceeds the group ECR. The target capital level for
insurance groups is set at 120% of its group ECR. In addition, under the tiered capital requirements described above, not more than certain specified
percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used by an insurance group to satisfy the Group Minimum Solvency Margin and group ECR
requirements. We are currently completing our 2020 Group BSCR, which must be filed with the BMA on or before May 31, 2021, and at this time, we
believe we will exceed the target level of required economic statutory capital. Our 2019 Group BSCR exceeded the target level of required statutory
capital. Further, our Board of Directors has established solvency self assessment procedures for the RenaissanceRe Group that factor in foreseeable
material risks; Renaissance Reinsurance must ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group’s assets exceed the amount of the RenaissanceRe Group’s
liabilities by the aggregate minimum margin of solvency of each qualifying member; and our Board of Directors has established and implements
corporate governance policies and procedures designed to ensure they support the overall organizational strategy of the RenaissanceRe Group. In
addition, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to prepare and submit to the BMA a quarterly financial return comprising unaudited consolidated group
financial statements, a schedule of intra-group transactions and a schedule of risk concentrations.
The BMA has certain powers of investigation and intervention relating to insurers and their holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates, which it
may exercise in the interest of such insurer’s policyholders or if there is any risk of insolvency or of a breach of the Insurance Act or the insurer’s license conditions. The BMA may cancel an
insurer’s registration on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act.
Under the provisions of the Insurance Act, the BMA may, from time to time, conduct “on site” visits at the offices of insurers it regulates. Over the past
several years, the BMA has conducted “on site” reviews in respect of our Bermuda-domiciled operating insurers.
Economic Substance Act. In December 2018, the Economic Substance Act 2018, as amended (the “ESA”) came into effect in Bermuda. Under the
provisions of the ESA, every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” must satisfy economic substance requirements by maintaining a
substantial economic presence in Bermuda. Under the ESA, insurance or holding entity activities (both as defined in the ESA and Economic Substance
Regulations 2018, as amended) are relevant activities. Pursuant to the ESA, certain of our entities registered in Bermuda, are required to demonstrate
compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.
Any entity that fails to satisfy economic substance requirements could face automatic disclosure to competent authorities in the EU of the information
filed by the entity with the Registrar of Companies in connection with the economic substance requirements and may also face financial penalties,
restriction or regulation of its business activities and/or may be struck off as a registered entity in Bermuda.
Income Taxes. Currently, neither we nor our shareholders are required to pay Bermuda income or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital
transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax in respect of our shares. We have obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the
Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, if Bermuda enacts legislation imposing any tax on profits, income, capital asset, gain or
appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax shall not be applicable to us, our operations or our shares, debentures or
other obligations until March 31, 2035, except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real
property owned or leased by us in Bermuda.
Policyholder Priority. As of January 1, 2019, the Insurance Amendment (No. 2) Act 2018 amended the Insurance Act to provide for the prior payment of
policyholders’ liabilities ahead of general unsecured creditors in the event of the liquidation or winding up of an insurer. The amendments provide, among
other things, that, subject to the prior payment of preferential debts under the Employment Act 2000 and the Companies Act 1981, the insurance debts
of an insurer must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts of the insurer.
Investment Fund Regulation. Medici, Upsilon Fund and RenaissanceRe Upsilon Co-Invest Fund Ltd. are registered or regulated by the BMA pursuant to
the Bermuda Investment Funds Act 2006, as amended from time to time (the “IFA”).
The purpose of the IFA is to set standards and criteria applicable to the establishment and operation of investment funds as defined in section 2 of the
IFA in Bermuda, with a view to protecting the interests of investors. Under the Bermuda Monetary Authority Act 1969, the BMA is responsible for
supervising, regulating and inspecting any financial institution which operates in Bermuda, including investment funds. The BMA has general powers to
supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of investment funds registered with it under the IFA and requires each fund registered under the IFA to
certify on an annual basis that the fund has complied with the IFA.
The BMA has also issued the Investment Fund Offering Document Rules 2019 and Investment Fund Rules 2019, both effective January 1, 2020. The
Offering Document Rules provide that an offering document for every registered or authorized fund be submitted to the BMA for approval and set forth
certain minimum content requirements for offering documents. The Investment Fund Rules set forth obligations of funds with respect to service providers,
depositary functions, safekeeping obligations, valuations, and reporting to investors and the public, among other requirements.","All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981. In addition, the Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations
(collectively, the “Insurance Act”), regulate the business of our Bermuda insurance, reinsurance and management company subsidiaries. RenaissanceRe also has operating subsidiaries registered as SPIs under the Insurance
Act, including Upsilon RFO. From time to time, RenaissanceRe’s Bermuda-licensed operating insurance subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and managed funds may apply
for, and be granted, certain modifications to, or exemptions from, regulatory requirements which may otherwise apply to them. The European Parliament recognizes Bermuda’s regulatory regime as achieving Solvency II equivalence for its commercial (re)insurers. Accordingly, audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP for each of Renaissance Reinsurance, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Vermeer and RREAG, Bermuda Branch must be filed with the BMA prior to April 30 of each year and are available free of charge on the BMA’s website. Statutory Financial Statements. The GAAP or IFRS financial statements are the basis on which statutory financial statements are prepared, subject to the
application of certain prudential filters as outlined in the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016. The statutory financial statements contain statements both on
a consolidated and unconsolidated basis. Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and publish a financial condition report
(“FCR”), which provides, among other things, details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework and solvency and
financial performance of the insurer/insurance group. In addition, we received approval from the BMA to file an FCR for
RREAG, in lieu of a standalone FCR for RREAG, Bermuda Branch. Minimum Solvency Margin. The minimum solvency margin for a Class 3A or Class 3B insurer is the
greater of (i) $1.0 million, (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written; if in excess of $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net
premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the
insurer’s ECR for the relevant year. Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is required to maintain its available statutory economic capital and
surplus at a level at least equal to its ECR which is established by reference to either the BSCR or an approved internal capital model. Eligibility limits are then
applied to each tier in determining the amounts eligible to cover regulatory capital requirement levels. The highest capital is classified as Tier 1 capital
and lesser quality capital is classified as either Tier 2 capital or Tier 3 capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1,
Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used to satisfy the Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers' minimum solvency margin, ECR requirements and target capital level. Restrictions on Dividends, Distributions and Reductions of Capital. Further, Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from
declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s
statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to
meet its Relevant Margins. Class 3, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of
the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year’s financial statements. Fit and Proper Controllers. For so long as
shares of RenaissanceRe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) or another recognized stock exchange, the Insurance Act requires that
the BMA be notified in writing within 45 days of any person becoming, or ceasing to be, a controller. A controller includes the managing director or chief
executive of the registered insurer or its parent company; a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller; and any person in accordance with whose
directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. In addition, all Bermuda insurers are also
required to give the BMA written notice of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45
days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer includes a director, secretary, chief executive or senior executive
performing the duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters by whatever name called. Material Change. Further, the BMA has the discretion to modify such
insurer’s accounting requirements under the Insurance Act. SPIs are generally required to prepare audited financial statements in accordance with GAAP or other
standards recognized by the BMA, as well as annual statutory financial statements, and file these statements with the BMA together with a statutory
financial return, which includes information around ownership structure, assessment of risks, analyses of premium, details of segregated cells, a
solvency certificate, and other information. Group Supervision. Pursuant to the Insurance Act, the BMA acts as the group supervisor of the RenaissanceRe group of companies (the
“RenaissanceRe Group”) and it has designated Renaissance Reinsurance to be the “designated insurer” in respect of the RenaissanceRe Group. The
designated insurer is required to ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group complies with the provisions of the Insurance Act pertaining to groups and all
related group solvency and group supervision rules. Under these rules, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to annually prepare and submit to the BMA
group GAAP financial statements, group statutory financial statements, a group capital and solvency return (including an EBS) and an FCR. The group is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be the
group actuary. In addition, under the tiered capital requirements described above, not more than certain specified
percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used by an insurance group to satisfy the Group Minimum Solvency Margin and group ECR
requirements. We are currently completing our 2020 Group BSCR, which must be filed with the BMA on or before May 31, 2021, and at this time, we
believe we will exceed the target level of required economic statutory capital. Our 2019 Group BSCR exceeded the target level of required statutory
capital. Further, our Board of Directors has established solvency self assessment procedures for the RenaissanceRe Group that factor in foreseeable
material risks; Renaissance Reinsurance must ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group’s assets exceed the amount of the RenaissanceRe Group’s
liabilities by the aggregate minimum margin of solvency of each qualifying member; and our Board of Directors has established and implements
corporate governance policies and procedures designed to ensure they support the overall organizational strategy of the RenaissanceRe Group. The BMA has certain powers of investigation and intervention relating to insurers and their holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates, which it
may exercise in the interest of such insurer’s policyholders or if there is any risk of insolvency or of a breach of the Insurance Act or the insurer’s license conditions. Over the past
several years, the BMA has conducted “on site” reviews in respect of our Bermuda-domiciled operating insurers. In December 2018, the Economic Substance Act 2018, as amended (the “ESA”) came into effect in Bermuda. Income Taxes. As of January 1, 2019, the Insurance Amendment (No. The amendments provide, among
other things, that, subject to the prior payment of preferential debts under the Employment Act 2000 and the Companies Act 1981, the insurance debts
of an insurer must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts of the insurer. Medici, Upsilon Fund and RenaissanceRe Upsilon Co-Invest Fund Ltd. are registered or regulated by the BMA pursuant to
the Bermuda Investment Funds Act 2006, as amended from time to time (the “IFA”). The BMA has general powers to
supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of investment funds registered with it under the IFA and requires each fund registered under the IFA to
certify on an annual basis that the fund has complied with the IFA. The BMA has also issued the Investment Fund Offering Document Rules 2019 and Investment Fund Rules 2019, both effective January 1, 2020."
Item 1,U.S. Regulation,"Admitted Company Regulation. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is a Maryland-domiciled insurer licensed in 26 states and the District of Columbia and
qualified or certified as a reinsurer in an additional 24 states. As a U.S. licensed and authorized insurer, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is subject to
considerable regulation and supervision by state insurance regulators. The extent of regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that
delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. Among other things, state insurance departments regulate insurer solvency, authorized investments, loss and loss adjustment expense and
unearned premium reserves, and deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations
of the affairs of authorized insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and
other matters. The Maryland Insurance Administration, as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s domestic regulator, is the primary financial regulator of
Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
Holding Company Regulation. We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Maryland, the domestic state of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
These laws generally require Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to file certain reports concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition and
general business operations with the Maryland Insurance Administration. Generally, all affiliate transactions involving Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.
must be fair and, if material or of specified types, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the Maryland Insurance Administration. Further,
Maryland law places limitations on the amounts of dividends or distributions payable by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Payment of ordinary dividends
by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. requires notice to the Maryland Insurance Administration. Declaration of an extraordinary dividend, which must be
paid out of earned surplus, generally requires thirty days’ prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval of the Maryland Insurance Administration. An
extraordinary dividend includes any dividend whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding
twelve months exceeds the lesser of (1) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) the
insurer’s net investment income, excluding realized capital gains (as determined under statutory accounting principles), for the twelve month period
ending December 31 of the preceding year and pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities, plus any amounts of net investment
income (subject to the foregoing exclusions), in the three calendar years prior to the preceding year which have not been distributed.
Maryland law also requires any person seeking to acquire control of a Maryland-domestic insurer or of an entity that directly or indirectly controls a
Maryland-domestic insurer, including its holding company, to file a statement with the Maryland Insurance Administration at least 60 days before the
proposed acquisition of control. The transaction seeking to acquire control cannot be made unless, within 60 days after the statement is filed with the
Maryland Insurance Administration, or within any extension of that period, the Maryland Insurance Administration approves, or does not disapprove, the
transaction. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company, its holding company or any other entity directly
or indirectly controlling the insurance company is presumed to have acquired control, unless the presumption is rebutted. Therefore, any investor who
intends to acquire 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s outstanding voting securities may need to comply with these laws and would be required to file
statements and reports with the Maryland Insurance Administration before such acquisition.
Maryland has adopted enterprise risk management and reporting obligations applicable to insurance holding company systems that are meant to protect
the licensed companies from enterprise risk. These obligations include requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person
identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the U.S. licensed companies.
Effective January 1, 2018, Maryland adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Act (the “RMORSA Act”) based on the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act. The RMORSA Act requires Renaissance
Reinsurance U.S. to: (i) maintain a risk management framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting its material and relevant
risks; (ii) complete an Own Risk Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) at least once each year and at any time there is a significant change to the risk profile
of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. or its holding company system; and (iii) submit an ORSA summary report to the Maryland Insurance Administration at
least once each year. The obligation to maintain a risk management framework may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group maintains a risk
management framework that applies to the operations of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. and the ORSA obligation may be satisfied if the
RenaissanceRe Group completes an ORSA in accordance with the requirements of the RMORSA Act. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is required to meet certain minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements under Maryland law. At December 31,
2020, we believe that Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus.
Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is also subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements under Maryland law. Each year, Renaissance Reinsurance
U.S. must file with the Maryland Insurance Administration a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. If the
report shows Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s statutory capital and surplus and any other items provided in the NAIC’s RBC instructions (“total adjusted
capital”) are below certain levels, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. may be required to take certain corrective action or the Maryland Insurance
Administration may be permitted or required to take certain regulatory action. As of December 31, 2020, we believe Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s
total adjusted capital exceeded the company action level and regulatory action level thresholds.
Regulation of RREAG, US Branch. RREAG, US Branch is a United States branch of RREAG whose port of entry is New York. RREAG, US Branch is
licensed in two states, New York and Kansas, and it is an accredited reinsurer in 48 states, and the District of Columbia. The NYDFS is RREAG, US
Branch’s domestic insurance regulator in the U.S. As a New York regulated insurer, RREAG, US Branch is subject to New York’s holding company
laws as well as laws pertaining to solvency, authorized investments, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders and cybersecurity. The NYDFS
may conduct periodic examinations of RREAG, US Branch’s affairs and it requires the filing of annual and other reports relating to RREAG, US Branch’s
financial condition.
RREAG, US Branch is required to meet certain trusteed surplus requirements under New York law. At December 31, 2020, we believe that RREAG, US
Branch’s trusteed surplus exceeded the minimum required statutory level.
Each year, RREAG, US Branch must file with the NYDFS a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. If the
report shows RREAG, US Branch’s total adjusted capital is below certain levels, RREAG, US Branch may be required to take certain corrective action
or the NYDFS may be permitted or required to take certain regulatory action. As of December 31, 2020, we believe RREAG, US Branch’s total adjusted
capital exceeded the company action level and regulatory action level thresholds. RREAG, US Branch does not pay ordinary dividends and would need
approval from the NYDFS for any return of capital to RREAG.
Run-off of RREAG, US Branch. In and subsequent to August 2019, we made certain filings with the New York and Maryland state insurance regulators
in contemplation of a run-off of RREAG, US Branch. Following receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the U.S. casualty portfolio was transferred to
Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. through a loss portfolio transfer retrocession agreement effective as of October 1, 2019, while the remaining property and
specialty business portfolio of RREAG, US Branch will be run-off until all liabilities are extinguished through novation, commutation or expiration, subject
to applicable ceding company consent. We expect that the run-off of RREAG, US Branch will not be complete for several years.
Reinsurance Regulation. The insurance laws of each U.S. state regulate the sale of reinsurance to licensed ceding insurers by non-admitted alien
reinsurers acting from locations outside the state. With some exceptions, the sale of insurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to
do business is prohibited. Our Bermuda-domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures (principally Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re,
RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., Upsilon RFO and Vermeer) are all admitted to transact insurance business in Bermuda and do not maintain an office or
solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any other jurisdiction where the conduct of such activities would require that any
company be so admitted.
RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Insurance as a reinsurance intermediary broker and is
required to maintain its reinsurance intermediary broker license in force in order to conduct its reinsurance operations in Connecticut.
Although reinsurance contract terms and rates are generally not subject to regulation by state insurance authorities, a primary U.S. insurer ordinarily will
enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit on its statutory financial statements for the reinsurance ceded. State insurance regulators
permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted, non-U.S. (alien) reinsurers if the reinsurance contract contains certain
minimum provisions and if the reinsurance obligations of the non-U.S.
reinsurer are appropriately collateralized. Qualifying collateral may be established by an alien reinsurer exclusively for a single U.S. ceding company.
Alternatively, an alien reinsurer that is accredited by a state may establish a multi-beneficiary trust with qualifying assets equal to its reinsurance
obligations to all U.S. ceding insurers, plus a trusteed surplus amount. Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci are each an accredited reinsurer and
have established multi-beneficiary trusts with a qualifying financial institution in New York for the benefit of their U.S. cedants. In 2020, RREAG was
approved to establish a multi-beneficiary trust which we expect will become effective in the first quarter of 2021.
States generally require non-admitted alien reinsurers to provide collateral equal to one hundred percent of their reinsurance obligations to U.S. ceding
insurers in order for the U.S. ceding insurers to obtain full credit for reinsurance. However, most states have adopted credit for reinsurance laws and
regulations based on NAIC model law and regulation amendments that permit U.S. ceding insurers to take full credit for reinsurance when a “certified”
reinsurer posts reduced collateral amounts. U.S. states are required to adopt the NAIC model law and regulation amendments permitting reduced
collateral for certified reinsurers as an NAIC accreditation requirement. Under these credit for reinsurance laws and regulations, qualifying alien reinsurers
may reduce their collateral for future reinsurance agreements based on a secure rating assigned by the U.S. insurance regulator. The secure rating is
assigned by the state upon an assessment of the reinsurer’s financial condition, financial strength ratings and other factors. In addition, the alien
reinsurer must be domiciled in a jurisdiction that is “qualified” under state law. The NAIC granted conditional qualified jurisdiction status to Bermuda and
Switzerland effective January 1, 2014, and approved Bermuda and Switzerland as qualified jurisdictions effective January 1, 2015 for a five-year period. In
December 2019, the NAIC voted to re-qualify Bermuda as a qualified jurisdiction effective January 1, 2020. Each of Renaissance Reinsurance,
RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci and RREAG has been approved as a “certified reinsurer” eligible for collateral reduction in various states.
Effective January 1, 2020, Bermuda and Switzerland were awarded “reciprocal jurisdiction” status by the NAIC. Once states have enacted legislation and
produced regulations to recognize and effectuate Bermuda's and Switzerland's reciprocal jurisdiction status, (re)insurers domiciled in those countries will
be eligible (on a state by state basis) to qualify for zero collateral relief, and thereby operate under standards equivalent to reinsurers domiciled in the UK
and EU. As noted below, UK and EU-domiciled reinsurers will be subject to the provisions of the US-UK Covered Agreement and US-EU Covered
Agreement, respectively (defined below) that require states to remove reinsurance collateral requirements for qualifying UK or EU reinsurers as of the US-
UK Covered Agreement's or US-EU Covered Agreement's implementation date.
NAIC Ratios. The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed
property and casualty insurance companies operating in their respective states. The NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System calculates these
ratios based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments. Each
ratio has an established “usual range” of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial
condition of insurance companies. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of such ratios is not considered a failing result; rather unusual values are
viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have
several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall outside of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific
transactions that are themselves immaterial.
Federal Oversight and Other Government Intervention. Government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the U.S. continues to evolve.
Although U.S. state regulation is currently the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance, Congress has considered proposals in several
areas that may impact the industry, including the creation of an optional federal charter and repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from
the McCarran Ferguson Act. We are unable to predict what other proposals will be made or adopted or the effect, if any, that such proposals would have
on our operations and financial condition.
The Dodd-Frank Act established federal measures that impact the U.S. insurance business and preempt certain state insurance laws. For example, the
Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which is authorized to designate a non-bank financial company as
“systemically important financial institution” (each a “non-bank SIFI”) if its material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, there were no non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC. In March 2019, in response to U.S.
Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) recommendations, the FSOC issued for public comment proposed guidance related to a revised
process for designating non-bank SIFIs, which substantially changes the FSOC’s existing procedures by emphasizing an activities-based approach, and
moving away from the existing entities-based approach. The FSOC’s adoption of this revised approach to identifying systemic risk or a determination
that we or our counterparties are non-bank SIFIs could affect our insurance and reinsurance operations.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”). The FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the
business of insurance, but it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements. The FIO is also
authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk and may recommend to
the FSOC the designation of systemically important insurers. In addition, the FIO represents the U.S. at the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors.
The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the U.S. Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to enter into international agreements of mutual
recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance (“covered agreements”). The U.S. and EU entered into a bilateral agreement
regarding the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance (the “US-EU Covered Agreement”) in 2017. Each party has been working to complete its
internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) in order to satisfy the US-EU Covered
Agreement’s substantive and timing requirements. For instance, in June 2019, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Amended Credit for Reinsurance Model
Act and Model Regulation (the “2019 Credit for Reinsurance Amendment”).
The US-EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential insurance and reinsurance supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the
exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. Under the US-EU Covered Agreement, reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to
qualifying EU reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the U.S. market, and U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU market will no longer be subject to “local
presence” requirements. The US-EU Covered Agreement also establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups
operating in both territories. For instance, the US-EU Covered Agreement provides that U.S. insurance groups with operations in the EU will be
supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators, and precludes EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital
requirements over the worldwide operations of U.S. insurers.
The US-EU Covered Agreement may preempt an inconsistent state law that treats a qualified non-U.S. reinsurer less favorably than a U.S. insurer
licensed in that state. The FIO is required under the US-EU Covered Agreement to commence this preemption analysis in April 2021 and to complete
this analysis in September 2022. This effectively means that each U.S. state will need to enact the 2019 Credit for Reinsurance Amendments by
September 2022, or face possible federal preemption of those provisions in its credit for reinsurance laws that are inconsistent with the US-EU Covered
Agreement.
See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information regarding recent legislative and regulatory proposals and the potential effects on our business
and results of operations.","Admitted Company Regulation. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is a Maryland-domiciled insurer licensed in 26 states and the District of Columbia and
qualified or certified as a reinsurer in an additional 24 states. As a U.S. licensed and authorized insurer, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is subject to
considerable regulation and supervision by state insurance regulators. We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Maryland, the domestic state of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. These laws generally require Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to file certain reports concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition and
general business operations with the Maryland Insurance Administration. Further,
Maryland law places limitations on the amounts of dividends or distributions payable by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Payment of ordinary dividends
by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. requires notice to the Maryland Insurance Administration. An
extraordinary dividend includes any dividend whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding
twelve months exceeds the lesser of (1) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) the
insurer’s net investment income, excluding realized capital gains (as determined under statutory accounting principles), for the twelve month period
ending December 31 of the preceding year and pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities, plus any amounts of net investment
income (subject to the foregoing exclusions), in the three calendar years prior to the preceding year which have not been distributed. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company, its holding company or any other entity directly
or indirectly controlling the insurance company is presumed to have acquired control, unless the presumption is rebutted. Maryland has adopted enterprise risk management and reporting obligations applicable to insurance holding company systems that are meant to protect
the licensed companies from enterprise risk. Effective January 1, 2018, Maryland adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Act (the “RMORSA Act”) based on the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act. The obligation to maintain a risk management framework may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe Group maintains a risk
management framework that applies to the operations of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. and the ORSA obligation may be satisfied if the
RenaissanceRe Group completes an ORSA in accordance with the requirements of the RMORSA Act. Each year, Renaissance Reinsurance
U.S. must file with the Maryland Insurance Administration a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. As of December 31, 2020, we believe Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s
total adjusted capital exceeded the company action level and regulatory action level thresholds. Regulation of RREAG, US Branch. RREAG, US Branch is a United States branch of RREAG whose port of entry is New York. The NYDFS is RREAG, US
Branch’s domestic insurance regulator in the U.S. As a New York regulated insurer, RREAG, US Branch is subject to New York’s holding company
laws as well as laws pertaining to solvency, authorized investments, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders and cybersecurity. The NYDFS
may conduct periodic examinations of RREAG, US Branch’s affairs and it requires the filing of annual and other reports relating to RREAG, US Branch’s
financial condition. RREAG, US Branch is required to meet certain trusteed surplus requirements under New York law. RREAG, US Branch does not pay ordinary dividends and would need
approval from the NYDFS for any return of capital to RREAG. Run-off of RREAG, US Branch. In and subsequent to August 2019, we made certain filings with the New York and Maryland state insurance regulators
in contemplation of a run-off of RREAG, US Branch. Reinsurance Regulation. With some exceptions, the sale of insurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to
do business is prohibited. RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Insurance as a reinsurance intermediary broker and is
required to maintain its reinsurance intermediary broker license in force in order to conduct its reinsurance operations in Connecticut. Qualifying collateral may be established by an alien reinsurer exclusively for a single U.S. ceding company. Each of Renaissance Reinsurance,
RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., DaVinci and RREAG has been approved as a “certified reinsurer” eligible for collateral reduction in various states. Effective January 1, 2020, Bermuda and Switzerland were awarded “reciprocal jurisdiction” status by the NAIC. Once states have enacted legislation and
produced regulations to recognize and effectuate Bermuda's and Switzerland's reciprocal jurisdiction status, (re)insurers domiciled in those countries will
be eligible (on a state by state basis) to qualify for zero collateral relief, and thereby operate under standards equivalent to reinsurers domiciled in the UK
and EU. As noted below, UK and EU-domiciled reinsurers will be subject to the provisions of the US-UK Covered Agreement and US-EU Covered
Agreement, respectively (defined below) that require states to remove reinsurance collateral requirements for qualifying UK or EU reinsurers as of the US-
UK Covered Agreement's or US-EU Covered Agreement's implementation date. The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed
property and casualty insurance companies operating in their respective states. Each
ratio has an established “usual range” of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial

Item 1,U.K. Regulation,"General. The operations of RenaissanceRe Syndicate Management Ltd. (“RSML”) are subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the
Lloyd’s Council. RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s may
require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. Lloyd’s also imposes various
charges and assessments on its members. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe Corporate Capital (UK) Limited’s
(“RenaissanceRe CCL”) underwriting business at Lloyd’s. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and
paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution.
By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, RenaissanceRe CCL has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s bye-laws and regulations as well
as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012 (the “FSMA”).
Capital Requirements. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or
“FAL”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the capital adequacy regime of the U.K.’s Prudential Regulation
Authority (the “PRA”). The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. Under
these requirements, Lloyd’s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency
margin. The amount of FAL for Syndicate 1458 is determined by Lloyd’s and is based on Syndicate 1458’s solvency and capital requirement as
calculated through its internal model. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses, the Lloyd’s Central Fund provides an additional level of
security for policyholders.
Restrictions. A Reinsurance to Close (“RITC”) generally is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account. On successful
conclusion of a RITC, any profit from the syndicate’s operations for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s
members. If the syndicate’s managing agency concludes that an appropriate RITC cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable
terms in respect of a particular underwriting year, it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run-off. During this period,
there cannot be a release of the Funds at Lloyd’s of a member of that syndicate without the consent of Lloyd’s.
The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch).
Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the rating of the Lloyd’s Market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating
agency is necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL would be
adversely affected if Lloyd’s current ratings were downgraded.
Intervention Powers. The Lloyd’s Council has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, withdraw a
member’s permission to underwrite business or to underwrite a particular class of business. The Lloyd’s Council may change the basis on which
syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd’s requirements or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s.
Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member’s participation in a given underwriting year. If a member of Lloyd’s is
unable to pay its debts to policyholders, the member may obtain financial assistance from the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which in many respects acts as an
equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium
levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Lloyd’s Council has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year
as a Central Fund contribution.
While not currently material to our operations, Syndicate 1458 also accesses insurance business from the European Economic Area though the Lloyd’s
Brussels Subsidiary. The Lloyd’s Brussels Subsidiary is authorized and regulated by the National Bank of Belgium and regulated by the Financial
Services and Markets Authority.
The PRA currently has ultimate responsibility for the prudential supervision of financial services in the U.K. The Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”)
has responsibility for market conduct regulation. As such, the PRA and the FCA regulate all financial services firms in the U.K. including the Lloyd’s
market, RSML and RenaissanceRe Europe AG, UK Branch (“RREAG, UK Branch”). Both the PRA and FCA have substantial powers of intervention in
relation to regulated firms.
Lloyd’s as a whole is authorized by the PRA and regulated by both the FCA and the PRA. Lloyd’s is required to implement certain rules prescribed by
the PRA and by the FCA; such rules are to be implemented by Lloyd’s pursuant to its powers under the Lloyd’s Act 1982 relating to the operation of the
Lloyd’s market. Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management
and control, solvency and various other requirements. If it appears to either the PRA or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory
responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the PRA or the FCA may intervene at their
discretion.
The European Parliament adopted Solvency II in April 2009 and it came into effect on January 1, 2016. Solvency II represents a risk-based approach to
insurance regulation and capital adequacy. Its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk, effect group supervision of
insurance and reinsurance affiliates, implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for (re)insurers across the EU Member States, establish consistent
corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies, and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance
operations. Under Solvency II, an insurer’s or reinsurer’s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an
internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the Member State’s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed
by the European Commission. Following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, and the expiry of the transition period on December 31, 2020, U.K. authorized
insurers will be subject to the U.K.'s separate domestic prudential regime. This regime is identical to the Solvency II regime from January 1, 2021,
although the two regimes may begin to diverge over time. The U.K. is currently undertaking a review of Solvency II and of the regulatory regime applicable
to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers.
The PRA granted approval to Lloyd’s internal model application in December 2015. Each year, the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency
test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If
Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or
reduce their underwriting.
RREAG, UK Branch is authorized and regulated in the U.K. by the PRA and by the FCA. RREAG, UK Branch was therefore subject to the Solvency II
regime, until January 1, 2021, at which point it became subject to the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime. However, notwithstanding these regulatory
changes, RREAG, UK Branch is still not required, nor will it be required under the terms of the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime, to hold capital at the
branch level. In light of this and related matters, the PRA granted various modifications and waivers to RREAG, UK Branch from its regulatory reporting
requirements.
The PRA and the FCA currently regulate the acquisition of control of insurers, reinsurers and Lloyd’s managing agents which are authorized under the
FSMA. Any company or individual that, together with its or his associates, directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares in such an entity or
its parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such entity or its parent company, would be
considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of
such entity or its parent company by virtue of their shareholding or voting power in either. A purchaser of 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s common
shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of RSML. Under the FSMA, any person or entity proposing to acquire
control over an insurer, reinsurer or Lloyd’s managing agent must give prior notification to the PRA and the FCA of their or the entity’s intention to do so.
The PRA and FCA would then have 60 working days to consider the application to acquire control. Failure to make the relevant prior application could
result in action being taken against RSML by the PRA or the FCA or both of them. Lloyd’s approval is also required before any person can acquire
control (using the same definition as for the PRA and FCA) of a Lloyd’s managing agent or Lloyd’s corporate member.
Lloyd’s worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to various regulations, laws, treaties and other applicable policies of the EU, as well as
of each nation, state and locality in which it operates. Material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse effect on Lloyd’s
and market participants, including RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL.","General. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe Corporate Capital (UK) Limited’s
(“RenaissanceRe CCL”) underwriting business at Lloyd’s. By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, RenaissanceRe CCL has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s bye-laws and regulations as well

Item 1,Switzerland Regulation,"Swiss Group Affiliate Companies and Reinsurance Branches. RREAG, a company limited by shares with its registered seat in Zurich, Switzerland, is a
reinsurance company licensed in class C1 and supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (""FINMA""). As such, RREAG must
comply with Swiss insurance supervisory law (as applicable to reinsurers), including in particular the Insurance Supervisory Act (""ISA""), Insurance
Supervisory Ordinance, FINMA ordinances and FINMA circulars. RREAG’s accounts are prepared in accordance with the Swiss Code of Obligations, the
Insurance Supervision Act and the Insurance Supervision Ordinance. RREAG maintains branch operations in Australia, Bermuda, U.K and the U.S.,
each in accordance with applicable local regulations.
Further, the group affiliates Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci each have a branch office registered with the commercial register of the Canton of
Zurich, Switzerland; however, as these are reinsurance-only branch offices of a foreign reinsurer, they are not currently subject to the license and
supervision requirements of FINMA.
The group affiliate RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG, a company limited by shares with registered seat in Zurich, Switzerland, is a service
company. Until December 31, 2019, it held a license granted by FINMA for the distribution of insurance-linked securities. This license type ceased to
exist on January 1, 2020 as a result of the new the Swiss Federal Financial Institutions Act and the Swiss Federal Financial Services Act, which
amended certain provisions of the Swiss collective investment schemes legislation. Thus, as of that date, RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG
has ceased to hold any FINMA license. However, RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG has affiliated with a Swiss ombudsman’s office and
registered the relevant client advisors with a Swiss recognized client advisor register in accordance with the Swiss Federal Financial Services Act, which
has enabled it to continue its distribution activities for insurance-linked securities.
Adequacy of Financial Resources. The minimum capital requirement for a Swiss reinsurance company under the ISA for reinsurance license class C1 is
CHF 10 million.
Being a Swiss domiciled reinsurance company, RREAG must further maintain adequate solvency and provide for sufficient free and unencumbered
capital in relation to its entire activities in accordance with the Swiss Solvency Test (the “SST”). The SST adopts a risk-based and total balance sheet
approach whereby reinsurance companies are required to provide a market-consistent assessment of the value of their assets and liabilities. The
solvency requirement is met if the available risk-bearing capital exceeds the required target capital. It is then assessed whether the identified available
capital can meet the SST requirements and is sufficient to cover the company’s obligations in less favorable scenarios. The European Commission
recognized the SST as being of an equivalent standard to European law with an effective date of January 1, 2016. The SST is also automatically
equivalent to the standards in the U.K.'s prudential regime following the expiry of the U.K.'s transition period for leaving the EU on January 1, 2021.
In addition, RREAG must establish sufficient technical reserves for its entire reinsurance business activities. RREAG also has to maintain an
organizational fund to cover the costs of establishing and developing the business, and for an extraordinary business expansion. The organizational fund
usually amounts to up to 50% of the minimum capital (as discussed above) at the start of business operations and subsequently should typically settle
at an amount equivalent to around 20% of the minimum capital. The exact minimum amount is determined by FINMA in each individual case.
Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. RREAG has to submit an annual report (consisting of the annual financial statements and management report)
and an annual supervisory report to FINMA by the end of June of the following year. In the course of the supervisory reporting to FINMA, RREAG has to
annually disclose its financial condition report containing quantitative and qualitative information, in particular relating to business activities, business
results, risk management, the risk profile and valuation principles and methods applied to provisions, capital management and solvency by the end of
April of the following year.
Moreover, under the ISA, a reinsurance undertaking must be organized in a way that it can, in particular, identify, limit and monitor all material risks. In
this context, RREAG must conduct a forward-looking self-assessment of their risk situation and capital requirements at least once a year, and a report
on the ORSA must be submitted to FINMA no later than the end of January of the following year.
Further, a reinsurance undertaking must maintain and file with FINMA a regulatory business plan, including details on its organization, financials,
qualified participants, management, oversight and control persons, responsible actuary, among other items. Any changes to the business plan must
either be approved by FINMA prior to the implementation or be notified to FINMA, depending on the type of change.
Dividends and Distributions. RREAG may only distribute dividends out of its retained earnings or distributable reserves based on the audited annual
accounts of the company. Any distribution of dividends remains subject to the approval of FINMA (as a change of the regulatory business plan) if they
have a bearing on the solvency of the reinsurer and/or the interests of the insured. The solvency and capital requirements must still be met following any
distribution. At December 31, 2020, we believe RREAG exceeded the minimum solvency and capital requirements required to be maintained under
Swiss law. RREAG was required to prepare an FCR for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is available on our website.","Swiss Group Affiliate Companies and Reinsurance Branches. As such, RREAG must

Item 1a,Risks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto will adversely impact our resultsof operations, financial
condition and other aspectsof our business ishighly uncertain and difficult to predict, and will depend on future developments.
We are closely monitoring developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus, and
are continually assessing its impact on our business and the insurance and reinsurance sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on
the global economy and financial markets, and has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such
as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. At this
time, it is not possible to estimate how long it will take to stop the spread and severity of the virus or the length and impact of government mitigation
actions in response thereto, but the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, both globally and in the
markets in which we participate. These conditions are expected to continue and potentially worsen, either in the near term or in future periods,
particularly if there are subsequent waves of infection.
As a result, we expect the pandemic will have a significant and ongoing effect on our business operations and current and future financial performance,
including in ways we cannot predict. We expect losses to emerge over time as the full impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are
realized. Developments in primary insurance claims handling and public sector initiatives may impact the emergence of insured losses. A longer or more
severe recession, or high unemployment levels will increase the probability of losses and may impact the demand for insurance and reinsurance. Our
ability to renew our current retrocessional reinsurance arrangements or obtain desired amounts of new or replacement coverage on favorable terms may
be reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could limit the amount of business we are willing to write or decrease the protection available to
us as a result of large loss events. Further, our counterparty credit risk may be exacerbated, as certain of our counterparties may face financial
difficulties in paying owed amounts on a timely basis or at all. Because this is an evolving and highly uncertain situation, it is not possible at this time to
estimate our ultimate potential insurance, reinsurance or investment exposure, or all other direct or indirect effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may
have on our results of operations and financial condition, although they are potentially severe. For information relating to the net negative impact of
COVID-19 losses on our underwriting result for the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ratings.” The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
could also exacerbate the other risks we face described herein. All of the foregoing events or potential outcomes, including in combination with other risk
factors included or incorporated by reference herein, could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any period, and, depending on
their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
Legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to
conduct our business.
Like many reinsurers and insurers, we have exposure to losses stemming from COVID-19 related claims. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic
triggers coverage is dependent on specific policy language, terms and exclusions. However, legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences may
impose new obligations on insurers in connection with the pandemic that extend coverage beyond the intended contractual obligations or result in an
increase in the frequency or severity of claims beyond expected levels, resulting in the emergence of unexpected or un-modeled insurance or
reinsurance losses. For example, many governments and regulatory bodies have considered proposals that would retroactively change the terms of
existing insurance contracts that generally exclude business interruption losses from pandemics. Should these proposals be reconsidered and enacted,
notwithstanding the fact that such losses fall outside of the terms and conditions of the original underlying contracts, and the fact that our own
reinsurance contract wordings may differ from underlying primary insurance policies and may be subject to different legal doctrines and choice of law
regimes, our reinsurance contracts could nonetheless be interpreted to provide coverage for these business interruption losses.
In addition, a number of proposals have been introduced or proposed to alter the financing of pandemic-related risk in several of the markets in which we
operate. It is possible that any such proposal, if ultimately adopted in the United States or other jurisdictions in which we provide coverage, could have
adverse or unforeseen impacts, such as reducing private market opportunities for insurance, reinsurance or other risk transfer products. These and other
future legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could have a material adverse impact on our business and make it difficult to predict the total amount of
losses we could incur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but these losses could be significant.
The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio and strategic investments, and may affect our ability to
access liquidity and capital markets financing.
Volatility in global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio and our strategic
investments. While the support from governments and central banks has helped address the economic impact, prolonged low, or negative interest rates
and a slowdown in global economic conditions have increased the risk of defaults, downgrades and volatility in the value of many of the investments we
hold. In addition, the steps taken, and the steps that may in the future be taken, by federal, state and local governments in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic, and the costs of such actions, may lead to higher than expected inflation and further financial stress on global financial markets.
In addition, certain jurisdictions may be considering imposing dividend restrictions on insurance companies, which, if enacted, would potentially impact
liquidity for holding companies who have insurance subsidiaries in those jurisdictions. For example, the European Insurance and Operational Pensions
Authority, the EU’s insurance regulator, has recommended that the approval of dividends from insurance companies be suspended while uncertainty over
the impact of the pandemic remains high. As a holding company with no direct operations, we rely on dividends and other permitted payments from our
subsidiaries and may be unable to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders if our operating
subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to us.
Measures taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our operationsor the operationsof our brokers, servicesproviders,
retrocessionaires and other counterparties.
From an operational perspective, our employees, directors and agents, as well as the workforces of our brokers, vendors, service providers,
retrocessionaires and other counterparties, may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or efforts to mitigate the pandemic, including
government-mandated measures described above. Remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk,
including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and adversely affect our ability to manage our business. Our company, in particular, depends in
substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers, and to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts the availability of
any of our key officers, or our efforts to recruit key personnel to Bermuda and other international locations, our business will be adversely affected.
Further, our operations could be disrupted to the extent that key members of senior management, board of directors or a significant portion of our
employees are unable to work due to illness, government actions, or otherwise. Additionally, if one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource
certain critical business activities experience operational failures as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19, or claim that they cannot
perform due to a force majeure, it may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.","We are closely monitoring developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus, and

Item 1a,RisksRelated to our (Re)insurance Business,"Our exposure to catastrophic events and premium volatility could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next
and could adversely impact our financial results.
We have a large overall exposure to natural and man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, winter storms, freezes, floods, fires,
tornadoes, hailstorms, drought, cyber-risks and acts of terrorism. As a result, our operating results have historically been, and we expect will continue to
be, significantly affected by low frequency and high severity loss events.
Claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results and could materially adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that certain factors, including increases in the value and geographic concentration of
insured property, particularly along coastal regions, the increasing risks associated with extreme weather events as a result of changes in climate
conditions, and the effects of higher than expected inflation (which may be exacerbated by the steps taken by governments throughout the world in
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic), may continue to increase the number and severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. This volatility
may be exacerbated by COVID-19 related increased demand on first responders and healthcare infrastructure, which may increase the severity of
catastrophic events due to limited resources and the increased likelihood that preparation orders or evacuation orders may be unheeded or met with low
compliance levels. Accordingly, unanticipated events could result in net negative impacts. Historically, a relatively large percentage of our coverage
exposures have been concentrated in the U.S. southeast, but due to the expected increase in severe weather events, there is the potential for significant
exposures in other geographic areas in the future.
Risks of volatility in our financial results are also exacerbated by the fact that the premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments
are prone to significant volatility due to factors including the timing of contract inception and our differentiated strategy and capability, which position us
to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring.
Our claims and claim expense reserves are subject to inherent uncertainties.
Our claims and claim expense reserves reflect our estimates, using actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of our expectations of
the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred.
We use actuarial and computer models (See “Part I, Item 1. Business—Underwriting and Enterprise Risk Management.”), historical reinsurance and
insurance industry loss statistics, and management’s experience and judgment to assist in the establishment of appropriate claims and claim expense
reserves. Our estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available
and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed, as loss trends and claims inflation impact future payments, or as current laws or
interpretations thereof change.
Due to the many assumptions and estimates involved in establishing reserves and the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques, the reserving process
is inherently uncertain. It is expected that some of our assumptions or estimates will prove to be inaccurate, and that our actual net claims and claim
expenses paid and reported will differ, perhaps materially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. For example, our significant
gross and net reserves associated with the large catastrophe events in the past several years, as well as those recorded in 2020 associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic, remain subject to significant uncertainty. As information emerges and losses are paid, we expect our reserves may change,
perhaps materially.
Accordingly, we may underestimate the exposures we are assuming and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted,
perhaps significantly. Conversely, we may prove to be too conservative and contribute to factors which would impede our ability to grow in respect of new
markets or perils or in connection with our current portfolio of coverages.
The trend towards increasingly frequent and severe climate events could result in underestimated exposures that have the potential to
adversely impact our financial results.
Our most severe estimated economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. The trend towards increased severity
and frequency of weather-related natural disasters and catastrophes which we believe arises in part from changes in climate conditions, coupled with
currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors which we believe increase the average economic value of expected
losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure,
global supply chains and agricultural production. Further, we believe that the recent increase in catastrophic events is indicative of permanent climate
change rather than transient climate variability. These and other factors may cause the potential for losses from natural disasters and catastrophes to be
unusually uncertain or volatile as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Accordingly, it is possible we will experience an increase in claim severity,
especially from properties located in these catastrophe-exposed regions, in the advent of near-term natural disaster activity.
A substantial portion of our coverages may be adversely impacted by climate change, and we cannot assure you that our risk assessments accurately
reflect environmental and climate related risks. We cannot predict with certainty the frequency or severity of tropical cyclones, wildfires or other
catastrophes. Unanticipated environmental incidents could lead to additional insured losses that exceed our current estimates, resulting in disruptions to
or adverse impacts on our business, the market, or our clients. Further, certain investments, such as catastrophe-linked securities and property
catastrophe joint ventures or managed funds, or other assets in our investment portfolio, could also be adversely impacted by climate change.
A decline in our financial strength ratingsmay adversely impact our business, perhapsmaterially so.
Financial strength ratings are used by ceding companies and reinsurance intermediaries to assess the financial strength and quality of reinsurers and
insurers. Rating agencies evaluate us periodically and may downgrade or withdraw their financial strength ratings in the future if we do not continue to
meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us. In addition, rating agencies may make changes in their capital models and rating
methodologies which could increase the amount of capital required to support the ratings.
A ratings downgrade or other negative ratings action could adversely affect our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers, as well as the
marketability of our product offerings, our access to and cost of borrowing and our ability to write new business, which could materially adversely affect
our results of operations. For example, following a ratings downgrade we might lose customers to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share
of the business of our customers or we could incur higher borrowing costs on our credit facilities.
In addition, many reinsurance contracts contain provisions permitting cedants to, among other things, cancel coverage pro rata or require the reinsurer to
post collateral for all or a portion of its obligations if the reinsurer is downgraded below a certain rating level. It is increasingly common for our reinsurance
agreements to contain such terms and/or to specify other circumstances under which we are required to post collateral such as in the form of letters of
credit, trust funds or other assets. Whether a cedant would exercise any of these rights could depend on various factors, such as the reason for and
extent of such downgrade or other circumstance, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. We cannot predict to what extent these contractual rights would be exercised, if at all, or what effect this would have on our financial condition or future
operations, but the effect could be material.
For the current ratings of certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and additional ratings information, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ratings.”
Emerging claim and coverage issues, or other litigation, could adversely affect us.
Unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our
insurance and reinsurance contracts. These developments and changes may adversely affect us, perhaps materially so. For example, we could be
subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent, or to increases in the number or size of
claims to which we are subject. In particular, legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences may impose new obligations on insurers or reinsurers in
connection with the COVID-19 pandemic that extend coverage beyond the intended contractual obligations, or result in an increase in the frequency or
severity of claims beyond expected levels. See “Legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our business.”
In addition, we believe our property results have been adversely impacted over recent periods by increasing primary claims level fraud and abuses, as
well as other forms of social inflation, and that these trends may continue, particularly in certain U.S. jurisdictions in which we focus, including Florida
and Texas. For example, in recent years, Florida homeowners have been assigning the benefit of their insurance recovery to third parties, typically
related to a water loss claim but also with respect to other claims. This practice is referred to as an “assignment of benefits” or “AOB,” and has resulted
in increases in the size and number of claims and the incidences of litigation, interference in the adjustment of claims, and the assertion of bad faith
actions and a one-way right to claim attorney fees. AOB and related insurance fraud may directly affect us, potentially materially, through any policy we
write in Florida, and by inflating the size of occurrences we cover under our reinsurance treaties and reducing the value of certain investments we have in
Florida, including both debt and equity investments in domestic reinsurers. In July 2019, Florida enacted an AOB reform bill intended to limit AOB
litigation by creating requirements for the execution of an AOB and allowing an insurance policy to prohibit an AOB, but there can be no assurance the
new legislation will reduce the impact of AOB practices.
With respect to our casualty and specialty reinsurance operations, these legal and social changes and their impact may not become apparent until
some time after their occurrence. For example, we could be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter, such as the potential for industry losses
arising out of a pandemic illness such as COVID-19, that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude. Moreover, irrespective of the
clarity and inclusiveness of policy language, we cannot assure you that a court or arbitration panel will enforce policy language or not issue a ruling
adverse to us. Our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance
and reinsurance contract and policy wording and by social inflation trends, including increased litigation, expanded theories of liability and higher jury
awards. These risks may be further exacerbated by the increasing trend of some primary insurers not to settle underlying claims.
All of these risks may be further heightened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to our reinsurance contracts, which may be
interpreted to provide coverage for COVID-19-related business interruption losses, notwithstanding the fact that such losses fall outside of the terms and
conditions of the original underlying contracts. Alternatively, potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could, if successful, reduce the market’s
acceptance of our related products. The full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. As
a result, the full extent of our liability under our coverages may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Furthermore, we expect that our
exposure to this uncertainty will grow as our casualty businesses grow, because in these “long-tail” lines claims can typically be made for many years,
making them more susceptible to these trends than our catastrophe business, which is typically more “short-tail.” While we continually seek to improve
the effectiveness of our contracts and claims capabilities, we may fail to mitigate our exposure to these growing uncertainties.
Retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms, or may not provide the coverage we intended to obtain, or we may
not be able to collect on claimed retrocessional coverage.
As part of our risk management, we buy reinsurance for our own account, which is known as “retrocessional reinsurance.” The reinsurance we purchase
is generally subject to annual renewal. From time to time, market conditions have limited or prevented insurers and reinsurers from obtaining
retrocessional reinsurance, which may be the case even when reinsurance market conditions in general are strong. In the current environment, our ability
to renew our current retrocessional reinsurance arrangements or obtain desired amounts of new or replacement coverage on favorable terms may be
substantially reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a series of prior year large loss events which had already begun to affect the
retrocessional market prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we may not be able to renew our current retrocessional reinsurance
arrangements or obtain desired amounts of new or replacement coverage, which could limit the amount of business we are willing to write or decrease
the protection available to us as a result of large loss events. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance, we may not be
able to negotiate terms that we consider appropriate or acceptable from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness or collect on claimed retrocessional
coverage. This could limit the amount of business we are willing to write or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events.
When we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance for our own account, the insolvency of any of our reinsurers, or inability or reluctance of
any of our reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. These
risks may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, if any of our counterparties face financial difficulties in paying owed amounts timely, or at all. We
have significant reinsurance recoverable associated with the large catastrophe events of the past several years and, generally, we believe that the
“willingness to pay” of some reinsurers and retrocessionaires is declining. Therefore, this risk may be more significant to us at present than at many
times in the past. Complex coverage issues or coverage disputes may impede our ability to collect amounts we believe we are owed.
A large portion of our reinsurance protection is concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers. The risk of such concentration of retrocessional
coverage may be increased by recent and future consolidation within the industry. The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, may lead to the increased
consolidation in the (re)insurance industry as larger, better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of
economic downturn and sustain or grow their business through the financial volatility.
We also sell retrocessional reinsurance to other reinsurers. See “We are exposed to counterparty credit risk, including with respect to reinsurance
brokers, customers and retrocessionaires” for certain counterparty risks that may be associated with this business.
We depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers for a preponderance of our revenue, and any lossof businessprovided by them could
adversely affect us.
We market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide through a limited number of insurance and reinsurance brokers. As our business is heavily
reliant on the use of a few brokers, the loss of a broker, through a merger, other business combination or otherwise, could result in the loss of a
substantial portion of our business, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Our ability to market our products could decline as a result of the
loss of the business provided by any of these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease. Further, due to the concentration of
our brokers, which increased following the closing of the acquisition of TMR, and may further increase following the closing of currently pending mergers
among brokers, our brokers may have increasing power to dictate the terms and conditions of our arrangements with them, which could have a negative
impact on our business.
A soft reinsurance underwriting market would adversely affect our business and operating results.
In a soft reinsurance underwriting market, premium rates are stable or falling and coverage is readily available. In a hard reinsurance underwriting market,
premium rates are increasing and less coverage may be available. Leading global intermediaries and other sources have generally reported that the U.S.
reinsurance market reflected a soft underwriting market during the last several years, with growing levels of industry wide capital being supplied
principally by traditional market participants and increasingly by alternative capital providers. While we believe that the current reinsurance underwriting
market has moved to a hard market phase, caused by recent withdrawals of alternative capital, the aggregation of multiple catastrophic events and
continuing prior year adverse development, we cannot assure you that the rise in rates will continue to accelerate, or be sustainable, as a result of the
uncertainty around the potential breadth and depth of losses that could arise from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we believe the market cycle
dynamic is likely to persist, and that we may return to soft market conditions in the future. However, it is possible that increased access of primary
insurers to capital, new technologies and other factors may reduce the duration or eliminate or significantly lessen the impact of any current or future
hard reinsurance underwriting market.
We could face losses from terrorism, political unrest and war.
We have exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, political unrest and acts of war. The frequency of these events has increased in recent
years and it is difficult to predict the occurrence of these events or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate. Accordingly, it is possible
that actual losses from such acts will exceed our probable maximum loss estimate and that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us.
We closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under reinsurance and insurance treaties. If we think we can
reasonably evaluate the risk of loss and charge an appropriate premium for such risk we will write some terrorism exposure on a stand-alone basis. We
generally seek to exclude terrorism from non-terrorism treaties. If we cannot exclude terrorism, we evaluate the risk of loss and attempt to charge an
appropriate premium for such risk. Even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage, we may not be able to completely eliminate
our exposure to terrorist acts.
We depend on the policies, procedures and expertise of ceding companies and delegated authority counterparties, who may fail to accurately
assess the risks they underwrite, which exposesus to operational and financial risks.
Like other reinsurers, we do not separately evaluate each primary risk assumed under our reinsurance contracts or pursuant to our delegated authority
business. Accordingly, we are heavily dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by our ceding companies and delegated authority
counterparties and are therefore subject to the risk that our customers may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured, or that the
premiums ceded to us will not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume, perhaps materially so. In addition, it is possible that delegated
authority counterparties or other counterparties authorized to bind policies on our behalf will fail to fully comply with regulatory requirements, such as
those relating to sanctions, or the standards we impose in light of our own underwriting and reputational risk tolerance. To the extent we continue to
increase the relative amount of proportional coverages we offer, we will increase our aggregate exposure to risks of this nature.
The reinsurance and insurance businesses are historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our productsmay decline, which would affect
our profitability.
The reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing
prices. Reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of
catastrophic events, perceptions of risk, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers. All of
these factors may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance and insurance industries. Over the last several years, the reinsurance and
insurance markets experienced a prolonged period of generally softening markets. This trend has recently shifted, however, and we cannot assure you
as to the duration or amplitude of the current or any potential future hard market cycle.
Our catastrophe-exposed lines are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments, including natural and man-made disasters. The
occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of catastrophic events, the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable, affects both industry results and
consequently prevailing market prices of our products.
We expect premium rates and other terms and conditions of trade to vary in the future. If demand for our products falls or the supply of competing
capacity rises, our prospects for potential growth, due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting, may be adversely affected. In particular, we
might lose existing customers or suffer a decline in business, which we might not regain when industry conditions improve.
Consolidation in the (re)insurance industry could adversely impact us.
The (re)insurance industry, including our competitors, customers and insurance and reinsurance brokers, has seen significant consolidation over the last
several years. The COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to increased consolidation as larger, better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position
than certain of their competitors to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain or grow their business through the financial volatility.
Should the market continue to consolidate, there can be no assurance we would remain a leading reinsurer. These consolidated client and competitor
enterprises may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services and/or obtain a larger market share
through increased line sizes. If competitive pressures reduce our prices, we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities, resulting
in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected earnings. As the insurance industry consolidates, competition for customers becomes more intense
and sourcing and properly servicing each customer become even more important. We could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition and
retention, further reducing our operating margins. In addition, insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated,
larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance. The number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline. Reinsurance intermediaries could also continue to consolidate, potentially adversely impacting our ability to access business
and distribute our products. We could also experience more robust competition from larger, better capitalized competitors. Any of the foregoing could
adversely affect our business or our results of operations.
We operate in a highly competitive environment.
The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers,
including other Bermuda-based reinsurers. Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do.
Historically, periods of increased capacity levels in our industry have led to increased competition and decreased prices for our products.
In recent years, pension funds, endowments, investment banks, investment managers, exchanges, hedge funds and other capital markets participants
have been active in the reinsurance market and markets for related risks, either through the formation of reinsurance companies or the use of other
financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. We may also face competition from non-traditional competitors, such as technology
companies, Insurtech start-up companies and others, who aim to leverage their access to “big data,” artificial intelligence or other emerging
technologies. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and
services.
We expect competition from these sources and others to continue to increase over time. It is possible that such new or alternative capital could cause
reductions in prices of our products, or reduce the duration or amplitude of attractive portions of the historical market cycles. New entrants or existing
competitors may attempt to replicate all or part of our business model and provide further competition in the markets in which we participate. Moreover,
government-backed entities increasingly represent competition for the coverages we provide directly or for the business of our customers, reducing the
potential amount of third-party private protection our clients might need or desire. To the extent that industry pricing of our products does not meet our
hurdle rate, we would generally expect to reduce our future underwriting activities, thus resulting in reduced premiums and a reduction in expected
earnings.
Additionally, in May 2020, the Federal Housing Finance Administration, the regulator and conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, issued a
proposed capital rule that would significantly reduce the value of credit risk transfer to government sponsored entities (“GSEs”), reinsurers and other
capital market participants if enacted. The proposal includes a series of “haircuts” to the GSEs’ credit for risk transfer, meaning they would be expected
to require a larger capital reserve even after transferring risk off their balance sheets. Accordingly, this could adversely impact the attractiveness to the
GSE of investing in private financial protection, including reinsurance, which have been a source of private market demand growth in our sector over
recent periods. We cannot assess with precision the probability these changes will be enacted or, if enacted, their exact impact on the markets in which
we participate.
We are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing or other new, proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the
risks for which we seek to provide coverage.
Internationally, restrictionson the writing of reinsurance by foreign companies and government intervention in the natural catastrophe market
could reduce market opportunities for our customers and adversely impact us.
Internationally, many countries with fast growing economies, such as China and India, continue to impose significant restrictions on the writing of
reinsurance by foreign companies. In addition, in the wake of recent large natural catastrophes, a number of proposals have been introduced to alter the
financing of natural catastrophes in several of the markets in which we operate. For example, the Thailand government has announced it is studying
proposals for a natural catastrophe fund, under which the government would provide coverage for natural disasters in excess of an industry retention and
below a certain limit, after which private reinsurers would continue to participate. The government of the Philippines has announced that it is considering
similar proposals. Indonesia’s financial services authority has announced a proposal to increase the amount of insurance business placed with domestic
reinsurers. A range of proposals from varying stakeholders have been reported to have been made to alter the current regimes for insuring flood risk in the
U.K., flood risk in Australia and earthquake risk in New Zealand. If these proposals are enacted and reduce market opportunities for our clients or for the
reinsurance industry, we could be adversely impacted.","Our exposure to catastrophic events and premium volatility could cause our financial results to vary significantly from one period to the next
and could adversely impact our financial results. We have a large overall exposure to natural and man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, winter storms, freezes, floods, fires,
tornadoes, hailstorms, drought, cyber-risks and acts of terrorism. As a result, our operating results have historically been, and we expect will continue to
be, significantly affected by low frequency and high severity loss events. This volatility
may be exacerbated by COVID-19 related increased demand on first responders and healthcare infrastructure, which may increase the severity of
catastrophic events due to limited resources and the increased likelihood that preparation orders or evacuation orders may be unheeded or met with low
compliance levels. Historically, a relatively large percentage of our coverage
exposures have been concentrated in the U.S. southeast, but due to the expected increase in severe weather events, there is the potential for significant
exposures in other geographic areas in the future. We use actuarial and computer models (See “Part I, Item 1. For example, our significant
gross and net reserves associated with the large catastrophe events in the past several years, as well as those recorded in 2020 associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic, remain subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we may underestimate the exposures we are assuming and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted,
perhaps significantly. The trend towards increased severity
and frequency of weather-related natural disasters and catastrophes which we believe arises in part from changes in climate conditions, coupled with
currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors which we believe increase the average economic value of expected
losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure,
global supply chains and agricultural production. Further, we believe that the recent increase in catastrophic events is indicative of permanent climate
change rather than transient climate variability. Accordingly, it is possible we will experience an increase in claim severity,
especially from properties located in these catastrophe-exposed regions, in the advent of near-term natural disaster activity. We cannot predict with certainty the frequency or severity of tropical cyclones, wildfires or other
catastrophes. In addition, rating agencies may make changes in their capital models and rating
methodologies which could increase the amount of capital required to support the ratings. A ratings downgrade or other negative ratings action could adversely affect our ability to compete with other reinsurers and insurers, as well as the
marketability of our product offerings, our access to and cost of borrowing and our ability to write new business, which could materially adversely affect
our results of operations. For example, following a ratings downgrade we might lose customers to more highly rated competitors or retain a lower share
of the business of our customers or we could incur higher borrowing costs on our credit facilities. It is increasingly common for our reinsurance
agreements to contain such terms and/or to specify other circumstances under which we are required to post collateral such as in the form of letters of
credit, trust funds or other assets. Whether a cedant would exercise any of these rights could depend on various factors, such as the reason for and
extent of such downgrade or other circumstance, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Ratings.”
Emerging claim and coverage issues, or other litigation, could adversely affect us. Unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our
insurance and reinsurance contracts. For example, we could be
subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent, or to increases in the number or size of
claims to which we are subject. Our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute insurance
and reinsurance contract and policy wording and by social inflation trends, including increased litigation, expanded theories of liability and higher jury
awards. All of these risks may be further heightened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to our reinsurance contracts, which may be
interpreted to provide coverage for COVID-19-related business interruption losses, notwithstanding the fact that such losses fall outside of the terms and
conditions of the original underlying contracts. The full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Retrocessional reinsurance may become unavailable on acceptable terms, or may not provide the coverage we intended to obtain, or we may
not be able to collect on claimed retrocessional coverage. As part of our risk management, we buy reinsurance for our own account, which is known as “retrocessional reinsurance.” The reinsurance we purchase
is generally subject to annual renewal. From time to time, market conditions have limited or prevented insurers and reinsurers from obtaining
retrocessional reinsurance, which may be the case even when reinsurance market conditions in general are strong. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such retrocessional reinsurance, we may not be
able to negotiate terms that we consider appropriate or acceptable from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness or collect on claimed retrocessional
coverage. This could limit the amount of business we are willing to write or decrease the protection available to us as a result of large loss events. A large portion of our reinsurance protection is concentrated with a relatively small number of reinsurers. See “We are exposed to counterparty credit risk, including with respect to reinsurance
brokers, customers and retrocessionaires” for certain counterparty risks that may be associated with this business. We depend on a few insurance and reinsurance brokers for a preponderance of our revenue, and any lossof businessprovided by them could
adversely affect us. As our business is heavily
reliant on the use of a few brokers, the loss of a broker, through a merger, other business combination or otherwise, could result in the loss of a
substantial portion of our business, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Our ability to market our products could decline as a result of the
loss of the business provided by any of these brokers and it is possible that our premiums written would decrease. A soft reinsurance underwriting market would adversely affect our business and operating results. In a hard reinsurance underwriting market,
premium rates are increasing and less coverage may be available. Leading global intermediaries and other sources have generally reported that the U.S.
reinsurance market reflected a soft underwriting market during the last several years, with growing levels of industry wide capital being supplied
principally by traditional market participants and increasingly by alternative capital providers. While we believe that the current reinsurance underwriting
market has moved to a hard market phase, caused by recent withdrawals of alternative capital, the aggregation of multiple catastrophic events and
continuing prior year adverse development, we cannot assure you that the rise in rates will continue to accelerate, or be sustainable, as a result of the
uncertainty around the potential breadth and depth of losses that could arise from the COVID-19 pandemic. We could face losses from terrorism, political unrest and war. We have exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, political unrest and acts of war. The frequency of these events has increased in recent
years and it is difficult to predict the occurrence of these events or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate. Accordingly, it is possible
that actual losses from such acts will exceed our probable maximum loss estimate and that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us. We closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under reinsurance and insurance treaties. We
generally seek to exclude terrorism from non-terrorism treaties. The reinsurance and insurance industries have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of decreasing prices followed by periods of increasing
prices. Reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in their results of operations due to numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of
catastrophic events, perceptions of risk, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and underwriting results of other insurers and reinsurers. Over the last several years, the reinsurance and
insurance markets experienced a prolonged period of generally softening markets. This trend has recently shifted, however, and we cannot assure you
as to the duration or amplitude of the current or any potential future hard market cycle. Our catastrophe-exposed lines are affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments, including natural and man-made disasters. The
occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of catastrophic events, the frequency and severity of which are inherently unpredictable, affects both industry results and
consequently prevailing market prices of our products. If demand for our products falls or the supply of competing
capacity rises, our prospects for potential growth, due in part to our disciplined approach to underwriting, may be adversely affected. These consolidated client and competitor
enterprises may try to use their enhanced market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services and/or obtain a larger market share
through increased line sizes. As the insurance industry consolidates, competition for customers becomes more intense
and sourcing and properly servicing each customer become even more important. In addition, insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their risks across a consolidated,
larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance. The number of companies offering retrocessional reinsurance may decline. The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. The proposal includes a series of “haircuts” to the GSEs’ credit for risk transfer, meaning they would be expected
to require a larger capital reserve even after transferring risk off their balance sheets. We are unable to predict the extent to which the foregoing or other new, proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the
risks for which we seek to provide coverage. Internationally, many countries with fast growing economies, such as China and India, continue to impose significant restrictions on the writing of
reinsurance by foreign companies. The government of the Philippines has announced that it is considering
similar proposals. A range of proposals from varying stakeholders have been reported to have been made to alter the current regimes for insuring flood risk in the
U.K., flood risk in Australia and earthquake risk in New Zealand. If these proposals are enacted and reduce market opportunities for our clients or for the
reinsurance industry, we could be adversely impacted."
Item 1a,RisksRelated to the Economic Environment,"We are exposed to counterparty credit risk, including with respect to reinsurance brokers, customers and retrocessionaires.
We believe our exposure to counterparty credit risk has increased in recent years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further heightened this risk. In
accordance with industry practice, we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay
these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us (we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers). Likewise,
premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers, who then pass such amounts on to us. In many jurisdictions, we have
contractually agreed that if a broker were to fail to make a payment to a ceding insurer, we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency.
Conversely, in many jurisdictions, when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us, these
premiums are considered to have been received by us upon receipt by the broker, and the ceding insurer is no longer liable to us for those amounts,
whether or not we have actually received the premiums. Consequently, in connection with the settlement of reinsurance balances, we assume a
substantial degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world.
We are also exposed to the credit risk of our customers, who, pursuant to their contracts with us, frequently pay us over time. We cannot assure you
that we will collect our premiums receivable from ceding insurers and reinsurers to whom we sell retrocessional reinsurance or our reinsurance
recoverable from our own reinsurers or retrocessionaires, which may not be collateralized, and we may be required to write down additional amounts in
future periods. To the extent our customers or retrocedants become unable to pay future premiums, we would be required to recognize a downward
adjustment to our premiums receivable or reinsurance recoverable, as applicable, in our financial statements. We have significant reinsurance
recoverable, and our failure to collect even a small portion of these recoverables, or a meaningful delay in the collection of recoverables as to which our
own underlying obligations are due, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially.
During periods of economic uncertainty, such as the current environment, our consolidated credit risk, reflecting our counterparty dealings with agents,
brokers, customers, retrocessionaires, capital providers, parties associated with our investment portfolio, and others may increase, perhaps materially
so.
Weakness in business and economic conditionsgenerally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could adversely
affect our business and operating results.
Challenging economic conditions throughout the world could adversely affect our business and financial results. When economic conditions weaken, as
they have as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business environment in our principal markets may be adversely affected, which tends to adversely
affect demand for certain of the products sold by us or our customers. In addition, volatility in the U.S. and other securities markets may adversely
impact our investment portfolio or the investment results of our clients, potentially impeding their operations or their capacity to invest in our products.
Global financial markets and economic and geopolitical conditions are outside of our control and difficult to predict, being influenced by factors such as
the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of government mitigation actions in response thereto, national and international political circumstances
(including governmental instability, wars, terrorist acts or security operations), interest rates, market volatility, asset or market correlations, equity
prices, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws or regulations including as regards taxation, trade barriers, commodity
prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates and controls. In addition, as discussed above, we believe our consolidated credit risk is likely to
increase as the global economy remains unsettled.
A decline in our investment performance could reduce our profitability and hinder our ability to pay claimspromptly in accordance with our
strategy.
We have historically derived a meaningful portion of our income from our invested assets, which are comprised of, among other things, fixed maturity
securities, such as bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, equity securities, and other investments, including but not limited to
private equity and private credit investments, bank loan funds and hedge funds. Accordingly, our financial results are subject to a variety of investment
risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, inflation, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and
credit and default risk. The volatility in global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the value of our investment portfolio and our strategic investments. See “The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our
investment portfolio and strategic investments, and may affect our ability to access liquidity and capital markets financing.” Additionally, with respect to
certain of our investments, we are subject to pre-payment or reinvestment risk. Our investment portfolio also includes securities with a longer duration,
which may be more susceptible to certain of these risks.
The market value of our fixed maturity investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in various factors, including prevailing interest rates
and credit spreads. Any decline in interest rates, including as a result of recent steps taken by governments throughout the world in responding to the
COVID-19 pandemic, or continuation of the current low interest rate environment could reduce our investment yield, which would reduce our overall
profitability. Conversely, increases in interest rates could cause the market value of our investment portfolio to decrease, perhaps substantially. Interest
rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and
other factors beyond our control. Any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may
not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity.
A portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other classes of investments including equity securities and interests in alternative investment
vehicles such as catastrophe bonds, private equity investments, private credit investments, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds. These
other classes of investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which is generally established on the basis of the valuation
criteria set forth in the governing documents of such investment vehicles. Such valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been
used had ready markets existed for the shares, partnership interests, notes or other securities representing interests in the relevant investment vehicles. We cannot assure you that, if we were forced to sell these assets, we would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them, and we
might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices. Furthermore, our interests in many of the investment classes described above are subject to
restrictions on redemptions and sales which limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term. These classes of investments may expose
us to market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, equity price risk and credit risk. The performance of these classes of investments is
also dependent on the individual investment managers and the investment strategies. It is possible that the investment managers will leave and/or the
investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines. Any of the foregoing could result in a
material adverse change to our investment performance, and accordingly, adversely affect our financial results.
In addition to the foregoing, we may from time to time re-evaluate our investment approach and guidelines and explore investment opportunities in
respect of other asset classes not previously discussed above, including by expanding our relatively small portfolio of direct investments in the equity
markets. Any such investments could expose us to systemic and price volatility risk, interest rate risk and other market risks. Any investment in equity
securities is inherently volatile. We cannot assure you that such an investment will be profitable and we could lose the value of our investment.
Accordingly, any such investment could impact our financial results, perhaps materially, over both the short and the long term.
We may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.
We routinely transact business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our financial reporting currency. Moreover, we maintain a portion of our cash and
investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and certain of our subsidiaries have non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Although we generally
seek to hedge significant non-U.S. dollar positions, we may, from time to time, experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these
foreign currencies, which could cause our consolidated earnings to decrease, or could result in a negative impact to shareholders’ equity. In addition,
failure to manage our foreign currency exposures could cause our results of operations to be more volatile. Adverse, unforeseen or rapidly shifting
currency valuations in our key markets may magnify these risks over time. The COVID-19 pandemic may also cause significant volatility in foreign
currency exchange rates. Significant third-party capital management operations may further complicate our foreign currency operational needs and risk.
Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our cost of capital and net investment
income.
As a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, a number of British Bankers’ Association member banks entered into
settlements with certain regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the British Bankers
Association, regulators or law enforcement agencies as a result of these or future events, may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is
determined. Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities. In addition,
changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which
could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities.
In addition, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority has announced its desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021, which may
affect us adversely. In November, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which currently administers U.S. dollar LIBOR, announced that it plans to cease
publication of one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR at the end of 2021, but plans to extend the publication of all other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings
until 2023. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our capital securities and credit instruments, which utilize
LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun
publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies
have also been announced. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to these new rates, and the effect that any changes in
LIBOR or the extension or discontinuation of LIBOR might have on new or existing financial instruments. As such, the potential effect of any such event
on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.
We may be adversely impacted by inflation.
We monitor the risk that the principal markets in which we operate could experience increased inflationary conditions, which would, among other things,
cause loss costs to increase, and impact the performance of our investment portfolio. We believe the risks of inflation across our key markets is
increasing over the medium to long term. In particular, the steps taken by federal, state and local governments in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the costs of such actions, may lead to higher than expected inflation. The impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines
of business that are considered to be long tail in nature, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims. Changes in the level
of inflation also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of loss reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business. The onset, duration
and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision.
We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.
To the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to support our future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through
financings or limit our growth. Our operations are subject to significant volatility in capital due to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic
events. Any further equity, debt or hybrid financings, or capacity needed for letters of credit, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us.
Our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time, including our financial position and operating
results, market conditions, and applicable legal issues. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it is likely that the strain on financial markets will
increase, and that access to public capital markets and private, third-party capital may become constrained, more expensive than in recent periods, or
contain more onerous terms and conditions. See “The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio and strategic
investments, and may affect our ability to access liquidity and capital markets financing.” We are also exposed to the risk that the contingent capital
facilities we have in place may not be available as expected. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital when needed, our business, results of
operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
In addition, we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise new capital for our joint ventures, managed funds and other private alternative
investment vehicles, which would reduce our future fee income and market capacity and thus negatively affect our results of operations and financial
condition. For example, it is possible that substantial losses ceded to the alternative capital sector over a period of years, and restraints on capital return and
maintenance of collateral for prior loss periods by a number of market participants, may contribute to a reduction in investor appetite to this product
class in the near term.
We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.
Publicly reported instances of cyber security threats and incidents have increased in recent years, and we may be subject to heightened cyber-related
risks. The extended period of remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate cybersecurity risks. Our business depends
on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems and our
proprietary systems. We are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including brokers, clients, vendors and others with whom
we do business, and with our Board of Directors. We believe we have implemented appropriate security measures, controls and procedures to safeguard
our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and we
periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of such systems, measures, controls and procedures and perform third-party risk assessments; however,
there can be no guarantee that such systems, measures, controls and procedures will be effective, that we will be able to establish secure capabilities
with all of third parties, or that third parties will have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of our information. Security breaches could
expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our information, litigation and potential liability.
In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems could have a significant
impact on our operations, and potentially on our results. We protect our information systems with physical and electronic safeguards considered
appropriate by management. However, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack
or similar event that may arise. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties.
Although we attempt to keep personal, proprietary and other sensitive information confidential, we may be impacted by third parties who may not have or
use appropriate controls to protect such information.
We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. A significant cyber incident,
including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable
cybersecurity and privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which
could be significant. While management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations, there can be no
assurances that a cyber incident that could have a material impact on us will not occur in the future.
Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers and cloud infrastructure. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to efficiently recover our key systems in accordance with these plans in the event that our primary systems are
unavailable due to various scenarios, such as natural disasters or that we have prepared for every disaster or every scenario which might arise in respect
of a disaster for which we have prepared, and cannot assure you our efforts in respect of disaster recovery will succeed, or will be sufficiently rapid to
avoid harm to our business.
The cybersecurity regulatory environment is evolving, and it is possible that the costs of complying with new or developing regulatory requirements will
increase. We are also required to comply with cybersecurity laws in other jurisdictions, in addition to similar laws and regulations that are being or may
be enacted in the future in other jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we operate in a number of jurisdictions with strict data privacy and other
related laws, which could be violated in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, or by our personnel. Failure to comply with these obligations can
give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.
See “Part I, Item 1. Business—Information Technology” for additional information related to information technology and cybersecurity. Acquisitionsor strategic investmentswe have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful.
As part of our strategy, we frequently monitor and analyze opportunities to acquire or make a strategic investment in new or other businesses we believe
will not detract from our core operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired
business or new personnel, could result in a substantial diversion of management resources.
Future acquisitions could likewise involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability
to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs. As we pursue or consummate a strategic transaction or investment, we may value the acquired
or funded company or operations incorrectly, fail to integrate the acquired operations appropriately into our own operations, fail to successfully manage
our operations as our product and geographical diversity increases, expend unforeseen costs during the acquisition or integration process, or encounter
other unanticipated risks or challenges. If we succeed in consummating a strategic investment, we may fail to value it accurately or divest it or otherwise
realize the value which we originally invested or have subsequently reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Any failure by us to effectively limit
such risks or implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
The lossof key senior membersof management could adversely affect us.
Our success depends in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers. The loss of services of members of our senior
management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team may strain our ability to execute our strategic
initiatives. Our operations could be disrupted, for example, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that key members of senior
management are unable to work due to illness, government actions, including travel restrictions, or otherwise. The loss of one or more of our senior
officers could adversely impact our business, by, for example, making it more difficult to retain customers, attract or maintain our capital support, or
meet other needs of our business, which depend in part on the service of the departing officer. We may also encounter unforeseen difficulties associated
with the transition of members of our senior management team to new or expanded roles necessary to execute our strategic and tactical plans from time
to time.
In addition, our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified underwriters and service
personnel. The location of our global headquarters in Bermuda may impede our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees, and it is possible
that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will increase these complexities. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians,
holders of Permanent Residents’ Certificates and holders of Working Residents’ Certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda
without a valid government work permit. Some members of our senior management are working in Bermuda under work permits that will expire over the
next several years. The Bermuda government could refuse to extend these work permits, and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be
issued or, if issued, renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term. If any of our senior officers or key contributors were not permitted to remain in
Bermuda, or if we experienced delays or failures to obtain permits for a number of our professional staff, our operations could be disrupted and our
financial performance could be adversely affected as a result.
We are exposed to risks in connection with our management of capital on behalf of investors in joint venturesor other entitieswe manage.
Our operating subsidiaries owe certain legal duties and obligations (including reporting, governance and allocation obligations) to third-party investors and
are subject to a variety of increasingly complex laws and regulations relating to the management of third-party capital. Complying with these obligations,
laws and regulations requires significant management time and attention. Although we continually monitor our compliance policies and procedures,
faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established policies and procedures, could result in our failure to
comply with applicable obligations, laws or regulations, which could result in significant liabilities, penalties or other losses to us and seriously harm our
business and results of operations.
In addition, in furtherance of our goal of matching well-structured risk with capital whose owners would find the risk-return trade-off attractive, we may
invest capital in new and complex ventures with which we do not have a significant amount of experience, which may increase our exposure to legal, regulatory and reputational risks.
In addition, our third-party capital providers may, in general, redeem their interests in our joint ventures and managed funds at certain points in time,
which could materially impact the financial condition of such joint ventures and managed funds, and could in turn materially impact our financial condition
and results of operations.
Certain of our joint venture and managed fund capital providers provide significant capital investment and other forms of capital support in respect of our
joint ventures and managed funds. The loss, or alteration in a negative manner, of any of this capital support could be detrimental to our financial
condition and results of operations. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract and raise additional third-party capital for our
existing joint ventures and managed funds or for potential new joint ventures and managed funds and therefore we may forego existing and/or potentially
attractive fee income and other income generating opportunities.
We may from time to time modify our business and strategic plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition.
We regularly evaluate our business plans and strategies, which often results in changes to our business plans and initiatives. Given the increasing
importance of strategic execution in our industry, we are subject to increasing risks related to our ability to successfully implement our evolving plans
and strategies, particularly as the pace of change in our industry continues to increase. Changing plans and strategies requires significant management
time and effort and may divert management’s attention from our core and historically successful operations and competencies. We routinely evaluate
potential investments and strategic transactions, but there can be no assurance we will successfully consummate any such transaction, or that a
consummated transaction will succeed financially or strategically. Moreover, modifications we undertake to our operations may not be immediately
reflected in our financial statements. Therefore, risks associated with implementing or changing our business strategies and initiatives, including risks
related to developing or enhancing our operations, controls and other infrastructure, may not have an impact on our publicly reported results until many
years after implementation. Our failure to carry out our business plans may have an adverse effect on our long-term results of operations and financial
condition.
Our current business strategy focuses on writing reinsurance, with limited writing of primary insurance, and our acquisition of TMR further concentrated
our strategy on reinsurance. In contrast, over the last several years, in connection with consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industries, certain
of our competitors increased the amount of primary insurance they are writing, both on an absolute and relative basis. There can be no assurance that
our business strategy of focusing on writing reinsurance, with limited writing of primary insurance, will prove prudent as compared to the strategies of our
competitors.
Our business is subject to operational risks, including systemsor human failures.
We are subject to operational risks including fraud, employee errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization,
failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements, failure of our service providers, such as investment custodians,
actuaries, information technology providers, etc., to comply with our service agreements, or information technology failures. Losses from these risks may
occur from time to time and may be significant. An extended period of remote work arrangements could increase or introduce new operational risk and
adversely affect our ability to manage our business.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requiresus to make many estimates and judgments.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities (including claims and claim expense reserves), shareholders’ equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to premiums written and earned, our net claims and claim expenses, investment valuations, income
taxes and those estimates used in our risk transfer analysis for reinsurance transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience, where
possible, and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for our judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our judgments and estimates may not reflect our actual results. insurance industry loss development patterns to establish our claims and claim expense reserves. Actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate,
perhaps materially, from the estimates reflected in our financial statements. For more details on our estimates and judgments, see “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”
The determination of impairments taken ishighly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or resultsof operations.
The determination of impairments taken on our investments, investments in other ventures, goodwill and other intangible assets and loans varies by type
of asset and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such
evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, including as a result of the ongoing and evolving
COVID-19 pandemic. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. There can
be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore, management
may determine that impairments are needed in future periods and any such impairment will be recorded in the period in which it occurs, which could
materially impact our financial position or results of operations. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments.
The covenants in our debt agreements limit our financial and operational flexibility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition. We have incurred indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness primarily consists of publicly traded notes,
letters of credit and a revolving credit facility. For more details on our indebtedness, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Resources.”
The agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to make particular types
of investments or other restricted payments, sell or place a lien on our or their respective assets, merge or consolidate. Certain of these agreements also
require us or our subsidiaries to maintain specific financial ratios or contain cross-defaults to our other indebtedness. If we or our subsidiaries fail to
comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios, the noteholders or the lenders could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of
all amounts owed to them or, where applicable, cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters of credit or, where the reimbursement obligations are
unsecured, require us to pledge collateral or, where the reimbursement obligations are secured, require us to pledge additional or a different type of
collateral.","In
accordance with industry practice, we pay virtually all amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay
these amounts over to the insurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us (we refer to these insurers as ceding insurers). Likewise,
premiums due to us by ceding insurers are virtually all paid to brokers, who then pass such amounts on to us. In many jurisdictions, we have
contractually agreed that if a broker were to fail to make a payment to a ceding insurer, we would remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency. Conversely, in many jurisdictions, when the ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment over to us, these
premiums are considered to have been received by us upon receipt by the broker, and the ceding insurer is no longer liable to us for those amounts,
whether or not we have actually received the premiums. We are also exposed to the credit risk of our customers, who, pursuant to their contracts with us, frequently pay us over time. We cannot assure you
that we will collect our premiums receivable from ceding insurers and reinsurers to whom we sell retrocessional reinsurance or our reinsurance
recoverable from our own reinsurers or retrocessionaires, which may not be collateralized, and we may be required to write down additional amounts in
future periods. We have significant reinsurance
recoverable, and our failure to collect even a small portion of these recoverables, or a meaningful delay in the collection of recoverables as to which our
own underlying obligations are due, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. In addition, as discussed above, we believe our consolidated credit risk is likely to
increase as the global economy remains unsettled. We have historically derived a meaningful portion of our income from our invested assets, which are comprised of, among other things, fixed maturity
securities, such as bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, equity securities, and other investments, including but not limited to
private equity and private credit investments, bank loan funds and hedge funds. Accordingly, our financial results are subject to a variety of investment
risks, including risks relating to general economic conditions, inflation, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and
credit and default risk. The volatility in global financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may continue to impact, the value of our investment portfolio and our strategic investments. See “The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our
investment portfolio and strategic investments, and may affect our ability to access liquidity and capital markets financing.” Additionally, with respect to
certain of our investments, we are subject to pre-payment or reinvestment risk. Any decline in interest rates, including as a result of recent steps taken by governments throughout the world in responding to the
COVID-19 pandemic, or continuation of the current low interest rate environment could reduce our investment yield, which would reduce our overall
profitability. Any measures we take that are intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment may
not effectively mitigate such interest rate sensitivity. A portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other classes of investments including equity securities and interests in alternative investment
vehicles such as catastrophe bonds, private equity investments, private credit investments, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds. These
other classes of investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, which is generally established on the basis of the valuation
criteria set forth in the governing documents of such investment vehicles. We cannot assure you that, if we were forced to sell these assets, we would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them, and we
might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices. These classes of investments may expose
us to market risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, equity price risk and credit risk. It is possible that the investment managers will leave and/or the
investment strategies will become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines. We may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations. Moreover, we maintain a portion of our cash and
investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and certain of our subsidiaries have non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Significant third-party capital management operations may further complicate our foreign currency operational needs and risk. In November, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which currently administers U.S. dollar LIBOR, announced that it plans to cease
publication of one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR at the end of 2021, but plans to extend the publication of all other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings
until 2023. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the terms of certain of our capital securities and credit instruments, which utilize
LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to these new rates, and the effect that any changes in
LIBOR or the extension or discontinuation of LIBOR might have on new or existing financial instruments. The impact of inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines
of business that are considered to be long tail in nature, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims. The onset, duration
and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision. Our operations are subject to significant volatility in capital due to our exposure to potentially significant catastrophic
events. Any further equity, debt or hybrid financings, or capacity needed for letters of credit, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. Our ability to raise such capital successfully would depend upon the facts and circumstances at the time, including our financial position and operating
results, market conditions, and applicable legal issues. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to raise new capital for our joint ventures, managed funds and other private alternative
investment vehicles, which would reduce our future fee income and market capacity and thus negatively affect our results of operations and financial
condition. We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks. Publicly reported instances of cyber security threats and incidents have increased in recent years, and we may be subject to heightened cyber-related
risks. Our business depends
on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, including communications and data processing systems and our
proprietary systems. However, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack
or similar event that may arise. A significant cyber incident,
including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable
cybersecurity and privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which
could be significant. While management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations, there can be no
assurances that a cyber incident that could have a material impact on us will not occur in the future. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers and cloud infrastructure. Failure to comply with these obligations can
give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Business—Information Technology” for additional information related to information technology and cybersecurity. Acquisitionsor strategic investmentswe have made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful. The negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired
business or new personnel, could result in a substantial diversion of management resources. Our success depends in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers. The loss of services of members of our senior
management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management team may strain our ability to execute our strategic
initiatives. Our operations could be disrupted, for example, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that key members of senior
management are unable to work due to illness, government actions, including travel restrictions, or otherwise. Some members of our senior management are working in Bermuda under work permits that will expire over the
next several years. If any of our senior officers or key contributors were not permitted to remain in
Bermuda, or if we experienced delays or failures to obtain permits for a number of our professional staff, our operations could be disrupted and our
financial performance could be adversely affected as a result. In addition, in furtherance of our goal of matching well-structured risk with capital whose owners would find the risk-return trade-off attractive, we may
invest capital in new and complex ventures with which we do not have a significant amount of experience, which may increase our exposure to legal, regulatory and reputational risks. In addition, our third-party capital providers may, in general, redeem their interests in our joint ventures and managed funds at certain points in time,
which could materially impact the financial condition of such joint ventures and managed funds, and could in turn materially impact our financial condition
and results of operations. Certain of our joint venture and managed fund capital providers provide significant capital investment and other forms of capital support in respect of our
joint ventures and managed funds. We regularly evaluate our business plans and strategies, which often results in changes to our business plans and initiatives. Given the increasing
importance of strategic execution in our industry, we are subject to increasing risks related to our ability to successfully implement our evolving plans
and strategies, particularly as the pace of change in our industry continues to increase. Moreover, modifications we undertake to our operations may not be immediately
reflected in our financial statements. Therefore, risks associated with implementing or changing our business strategies and initiatives, including risks
related to developing or enhancing our operations, controls and other infrastructure, may not have an impact on our publicly reported results until many
years after implementation. Our failure to carry out our business plans may have an adverse effect on our long-term results of operations and financial
condition. In contrast, over the last several years, in connection with consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industries, certain
of our competitors increased the amount of primary insurance they are writing, both on an absolute and relative basis. We are subject to operational risks including fraud, employee errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization,
failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements, failure of our service providers, such as investment custodians,
actuaries, information technology providers, etc., to comply with our service agreements, or information technology failures. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities (including claims and claim expense reserves), shareholders’ equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to premiums written and earned, our net claims and claim expenses, investment valuations, income
taxes and those estimates used in our risk transfer analysis for reinsurance transactions. Actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate,

collateral."
Item 1a,RisksRelated to Legal and Regulatory Matters,"The regulatory systemsunder which we operate and potential changes thereto could restrict our ability to operate, increase our costs, or
otherwise adversely impact us.
Certain of our operating subsidiaries are not licensed or admitted in any jurisdiction except Bermuda, conduct business only from their principal offices in
Bermuda and do not maintain offices in the U.S. The insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in
many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe. If our Bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any
state in the U.S., jurisdictions in the EU, or elsewhere, we could face challenges to the future operations of these companies.
Moreover, we could be put at a competitive disadvantage in the future with respect to competitors that are licensed and admitted in U.S. jurisdictions.
Among other things, jurisdictions in the U.S. do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted
insurers on their statutory financial statements unless security is posted. Our contracts generally require us to post a letter of credit or provide other
security (e.g., through a multi-beneficiary reinsurance trust). In order to post these letters of credit, issuing banks generally require collateral. It is
possible that the EU or other countries might adopt a similar regime in the future, or that U.S. or European regulations could be altered in a way that
treats Bermuda-based companies disparately. It is possible that individual jurisdiction or cross border regulatory developments could adversely
differentiate Bermuda, the jurisdiction in which we are subject to group supervision, or could exclude Bermuda-based companies from benefits such as
market access, mutual recognition or reciprocal rights made available to other jurisdictions, which could adversely impact us, perhaps significantly. Any such development, or our inability to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required, could
significantly and negatively affect our operations.
As a result of the acquisition of TMR, we became subject to the requirements of certain regulatory agencies and bodies to which our operations were not
previously subject, including in New York, Switzerland and Australia, resulting in additional costs to us. In addition, we could be required to allocate
considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including
Bermuda, Switzerland, Maryland and the U.K. Any such requirements could impact the operations of our insurance and/or non-insurance subsidiaries,
result in increased costs for us and impact our financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has further heightened regulatory scrutiny on our
industry, and the costs of complying with related regulatory inquiries could be significant. Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if a regulatory
authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulations.
Our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation.
Any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business, and could also result in
fines and other sanctions, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations.
We face risks related to changes in Bermuda law and regulations, and the political environment in Bermuda.
We are incorporated in Bermuda and many of our operating companies are domiciled in Bermuda. Therefore, our exposure to potential changes in
Bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations, such as the imposition of tax liability, increased regulatory supervision
or changes in regulation is heightened. The Bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny
in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., in various states within the U.S. and in the EU. We are unable to predict the future impact on our operations
of changes in Bermuda laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject.
In addition, we are subject to changes in the political environment in Bermuda, which could make it difficult to operate in, or attract talent to, Bermuda.
For example, Bermuda is a small jurisdiction and may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with
larger jurisdictions such as the U.S. or the leading EU and Asian countries. In addition, Bermuda, which is currently an overseas territory of the U.K.,
may consider changes to its relationship with the U.K. in the future. These changes could adversely affect Bermuda or the international reinsurance
market focused there, either of which could adversely impact us commercially.
Like many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, Bermuda has been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including substantial economic
and fiscal impacts. The Government of Bermuda has announced a comprehensive legislative and policy review intended to mitigate these impacts and
accelerate economic growth. While no specific proposals have been announced at this time, it is possible we could be adversely impacted by, for
example, changes to tax or immigration policy.
Because we are a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and payments from our subsidiaries. As a holding company with no direct operations, we rely on our investment income, cash dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt and to pay dividends to our shareholders. From time to time, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to meet these obligations. Regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends under Bermuda law, Swiss law and various U.S. laws regulate the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. If our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us, we may be unable to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repay our indebtedness. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain jurisdictions may be considering imposing dividend restrictions on insurance companies, which, if enacted, would potentially impact liquidity for holding companies who have insurance subsidiaries in those jurisdictions. See “The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio and strategic investments, and may affect our ability to access liquidity and capital markets financing.” Some aspectsof our corporate structure may discourage third-party takeovers and other transactionsor prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.
Some provisions of our amended and restated bye-laws (“Bye-laws”) may discourage third parties from making unsolicited takeover bids or prevent the
removal of our current board of directors and management. In particular, our Bye-Laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result
in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute 9.9% or more of any class or series of our shares, unless otherwise waived at the discretion of
the Board. In addition, our Bye-Laws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning, directly or indirectly, beneficially or otherwise, more than
9.9% of our common shares to not more than 9.9% of the total voting power of our shares unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the Board. These
provisions may have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of our common shares or proposals to acquire us, even if our shareholders might
deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests.
In addition, our Bye-Laws provide for, among other things: a classified Board, whose size is generally fixed and whose members may be removed by the shareholders only for cause upon a 66 2/3% vote; restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors, submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and requisition special general meetings; a large number of authorized but unissued shares which may be issued by the Board without further shareholder action; and a 66 2/3% shareholder vote to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with several provisions of the Bye-Laws.
These Bye-Law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy contest or otherwise
and could discourage a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, these Bye-Law
provisions could prevent the removal of our current Board of Directors and management. To the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts,
they could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of the shares.
In addition, many jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate, including Maryland, New York, the U.K., Switzerland and
Australia, have laws and regulations that require regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Where such
laws apply to us and our subsidiaries, there can be no effective change in our control unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement
with the regulators and has obtained prior approval for the proposed change from such regulators. Under these laws, control is typically presumed when
a person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable.
Therefore, a person may not acquire 10% or more of our common shares without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulators.
Investorsmay have difficulty in serving processor enforcing judgments against us in the U.S.
We are a Bermuda company. In addition, certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the U.S. All or a substantial portion of our
assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the U.S. Investors may have difficulty effecting service of process
within the U.S. on our directors and officers who reside outside the U.S. or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of U.S.
courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the U.S. to receive service of process.
Recent or future U.S. federal or state legislation may impact the private markets and decrease the demand for our property reinsurance
products, which would adversely affect our business and resultsof operations.
Legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a state, regional or federal level. In the past, federal bills have been proposed in
Congress which would, if enacted, create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks, including those we currently
insure and reinsure in the private markets. These measures were not enacted by Congress; however, new bills to create a federal catastrophe
reinsurance program to back up state insurance or reinsurance programs, or to establish other similar or analogous funding mechanisms or structures, may be introduced. We believe that such legislation, if enacted, could contribute
to the growth, creation or alteration of state insurance entities in a manner that would be adverse to us and to market participants more generally. If
enacted, bills of this nature would likely further erode the role of private market catastrophe reinsurers and could adversely impact our financial results,
perhaps materially. Moreover, we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded
capacity of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“Citizens”) and of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”). This could lead either to a
severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the Florida market, either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and
reinsurance industry.
From time to time, the state of Florida has enacted legislation altering the size and the terms and operations of the FHCF and the state sponsored
insurer, Citizens. For example, in 2007 legislation expanded the FHCF’s provision of below-market rate reinsurance to up to $28.0 billion per season and
expanded the ability of Citizens to compete with private insurance companies and other companies that cede business to us, which reduced the role of
the private insurance and reinsurance markets in Florida. Much of the impact of the 2007 legislation was repealed over time. At this time, we cannot
assess the likelihood of other related legislation passing, or the precise impact on us, our clients or the market should any such legislation be adopted.
Because we are one of the largest providers of catastrophe-exposed coverage globally and in Florida, adverse legislation such as the 2007 bill, or the
weakened financial position of Florida insurers which resulted in 2007 and could result from future legislation or other occurrences, may have a greater
adverse impact on us than it would on other reinsurance market participants. In addition, other states, particularly those with Atlantic or Gulf Coast
exposures or seismic exposures (such as California), may enact new or expanded legislation based on the prior Florida legislation, or otherwise, that
would diminish aggregate private market demand for our products.
It is also possible that the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could cause some governments, including cities, counties,
states, and national governments, to look at risk transfer as a means to create budgeting certainty. These initiatives could create public entity risk
transfer opportunities in the U.S. and globally. However, given the early stages of these proposals, it is difficult to predict at this time the impact they
may have on our business in the future, and we cannot assure you that the terms of any such facilities would be attractive.
See “Legislative, regulatory, judicial or social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to
conduct our business” for a further discussion of how these risks are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other political, regulatory and industry initiativesby state and international authorities could adversely affect our business.
The insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to heavy scrutiny by the U.S. and individual state governments, as well as an increasing
number of international authorities, and we believe it is likely there will be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in the future. For example, the
U.S. federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years (including as specifically addressed in the
Dodd-Frank Act), and some states, including Maryland and New York, have enacted laws that increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance
companies and holding companies. Moreover, the NAIC, which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations. We could also be adversely affected by proposals or
enacted legislation to expand the scope of coverage under existing policies for perils such as hurricanes or earthquakes or for a pandemic disease
outbreak, mandate the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies, expand the scope of the Federal Insurance Office or establish a new federal
insurance regulator, revise laws, regulations, or contracts under which we operate, disproportionately benefit the companies of one country over those of
another or repeal or diminish the insurance company antitrust exemption from the McCarran Ferguson Act. See also “Legislative, regulatory, judicial or
social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our business.” Our jurisdiction of
Bermuda is also subject to increasing scrutiny by political bodies outside of Bermuda, including the EU Code of Conduct Group. See “The OECD and
the EU may pursue measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income and increase our reporting requirements.” Due to this increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the reinsurance industry and Bermuda, our cost of compliance with applicable laws may increase, which could result in a decrease to both our profitability and the amount of time that our senior management allocates to running our day-to-day operations.
Further, as we continue to expand our business operations to different regions of the world outside of Bermuda, we are increasingly subject to new and
additional regulations with respect to our operations, including, for example, laws relating to anti-corruption and anti-bribery, which have received
increased scrutiny in recent years.
The changes in the administration following the 2020 U.S. presidential and congressional elections could have further impacts on our industry if new
legislative or regulatory reforms are adopted. We are unable to predict at this time the effect of any such reforms.
Our business is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to sanctions and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could
adversely affect our operations.
We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions. U.S. laws and
regulations that may be applicable to us in certain circumstances include the economic trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control as well as certain laws administered by the U.S. Department of State. The sanctions laws and regulations of
non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate may differ to some degree from those of the U.S. and these differences may additionally expose us to
sanctions violations. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit corrupt payments
or improper gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these
laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or intermediary could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In such event, we could
be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other punitive actions. In addition, such violations could damage
our business and/or our reputation. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our business and/or reputation could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Increasing barriers to free trade and the free flow of capital could adversely affect the reinsurance industry and our business.
Political initiatives to restrict free trade and close markets, for example by renegotiating or terminating existing bilateral and multilateral trade
arrangements, could adversely affect the reinsurance industry and our business. The reinsurance industry is disproportionately impacted by restraints on
the free flow of capital and risk because the value it provides depends on our ability to globally diversify risk.
Regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rulesmay adversely impact financial results irrespective of businessoperations.
Accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles, both prospectively and for prior periods, and such
changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Required modification of our existing principles, and new disclosure requirements, could
have an impact on our results of operations and increase our expenses in order to implement and comply with any new requirements.
The exit by the U.K. from the EU (“Brexit”) could adversely affect our business.
The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020 pursuant to the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the U.K. government and the EU Council
(the “Withdrawal Agreement”). The Withdrawal Agreement allowed for a transition period during which the U.K.’s trading relationship with the EU
remained largely unchanged while the future terms of that relationship were being negotiated. That transition period has now ended, and in December
2020, the U.K. and the EU announced that they had struck a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing certain aspects of the future relationship
between the U.K. and the EU (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”), which sets out the principles of the relationship between the EU and the U.K.
following the end of the transition period. The European Commission has proposed to apply the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on a provisional basis
until February 28, 2021, by which time the Trade and Cooperation Agreement must be approved by the European Parliament.
The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides clarity in respect of the future trade in certain goods and services between the U.K. and the EU.
However, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not cover all aspects of the future relationship between the U.K. and EU. For example, matters
relating to the equivalence of financial services regulation or the adequacy of U.K. data protection rules are not covered by the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement. Therefore, there remain unavoidable uncertainties related to Brexit, and the new relationship between the U.K. and EU, which could cause
volatility in currency exchange rates, in interest rates, and in EU, U.K. or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions. This could
contribute to instability in political institutions, regulatory agencies, and financial markets. These uncertainties could increase the volatility of, or reduce,
our investment results in particular periods or over time.
Notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, in particular, the economies of the U.K. and EU Member States, and individual businesses
operating in one or more of those jurisdictions, may be adversely affected by the restrictions on the ability to provide cross-border services from the U.K.
into the EU and vice versa, the introduction of trade barriers, customs checks and/or duties, changes in tax, restrictions on the movements of employees
and restrictions on the transfer of personal data. In addition, there are likely to be changes in the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties
across all industries, particularly in the services sector (including financial services). Any issues related to the adoption and interpretation of the Trade
and Cooperation Agreement could adversely and significantly affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions. Any of these effects of
Brexit, and others which cannot be anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.","In order to post these letters of credit, issuing banks generally require collateral. It is possible that individual jurisdiction or cross border regulatory developments could adversely
differentiate Bermuda, the jurisdiction in which we are subject to group supervision, or could exclude Bermuda-based companies from benefits such as
market access, mutual recognition or reciprocal rights made available to other jurisdictions, which could adversely impact us, perhaps significantly. Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if a regulatory
authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulations. We are unable to predict the future impact on our operations
of changes in Bermuda laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject. For example, Bermuda is a small jurisdiction and may be disadvantaged in participating in global or cross border regulatory matters as compared with
larger jurisdictions such as the U.S. or the leading EU and Asian countries. These changes could adversely affect Bermuda or the international reinsurance
market focused there, either of which could adversely impact us commercially. Like many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, Bermuda has been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including substantial economic
and fiscal impacts. While no specific proposals have been announced at this time, it is possible we could be adversely impacted by, for
example, changes to tax or immigration policy. From time to time, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to meet these obligations. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain jurisdictions may be considering imposing dividend restrictions on insurance companies, which, if enacted, would potentially impact liquidity for holding companies who have insurance subsidiaries in those jurisdictions. In particular, our Bye-Laws prohibit transfers of our capital shares if the transfer would result
in a person owning or controlling shares that constitute 9.9% or more of any class or series of our shares, unless otherwise waived at the discretion of
the Board. In addition, our Bye-Laws reduce the total voting power of any shareholder owning, directly or indirectly, beneficially or otherwise, more than
9.9% of our common shares to not more than 9.9% of the total voting power of our shares unless otherwise waived at the discretion of the Board. Where such
laws apply to us and our subsidiaries, there can be no effective change in our control unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement
with the regulators and has obtained prior approval for the proposed change from such regulators. Under these laws, control is typically presumed when
a person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the insurance company or its parent, although this presumption is rebuttable. Investorsmay have difficulty in serving processor enforcing judgments against us in the U.S.
We are a Bermuda company. In addition, certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the U.S. All or a substantial portion of our
assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the U.S. Investors may have difficulty effecting service of process
within the U.S. on our directors and officers who reside outside the U.S. or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of U.S.
courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws whether or not we appoint an agent in the U.S. to receive service of process. Recent or future U.S. federal or state legislation may impact the private markets and decrease the demand for our property reinsurance
products, which would adversely affect our business and resultsof operations. In the past, federal bills have been proposed in
Congress which would, if enacted, create a federal reinsurance backstop or guarantee mechanism for catastrophic risks, including those we currently
insure and reinsure in the private markets. These measures were not enacted by Congress; however, new bills to create a federal catastrophe
reinsurance program to back up state insurance or reinsurance programs, or to establish other similar or analogous funding mechanisms or structures, may be introduced. We believe that such legislation, if enacted, could contribute
to the growth, creation or alteration of state insurance entities in a manner that would be adverse to us and to market participants more generally. Because we are one of the largest providers of catastrophe-exposed coverage globally and in Florida, adverse legislation such as the 2007 bill, or the
weakened financial position of Florida insurers which resulted in 2007 and could result from future legislation or other occurrences, may have a greater
adverse impact on us than it would on other reinsurance market participants. In addition, other states, particularly those with Atlantic or Gulf Coast
exposures or seismic exposures (such as California), may enact new or expanded legislation based on the prior Florida legislation, or otherwise, that
would diminish aggregate private market demand for our products. It is also possible that the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could cause some governments, including cities, counties,
states, and national governments, to look at risk transfer as a means to create budgeting certainty. However, given the early stages of these proposals, it is difficult to predict at this time the impact they
may have on our business in the future, and we cannot assure you that the terms of any such facilities would be attractive. Other political, regulatory and industry initiativesby state and international authorities could adversely affect our business. For example, the
U.S. federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years (including as specifically addressed in the
Dodd-Frank Act), and some states, including Maryland and New York, have enacted laws that increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance
companies and holding companies. Moreover, the NAIC, which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations. See also “Legislative, regulatory, judicial or
social influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our business.” Our jurisdiction of
Bermuda is also subject to increasing scrutiny by political bodies outside of Bermuda, including the EU Code of Conduct Group. See “The OECD and
the EU may pursue measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income and increase our reporting requirements.” Due to this increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the reinsurance industry and Bermuda, our cost of compliance with applicable laws may increase, which could result in a decrease to both our profitability and the amount of time that our senior management allocates to running our day-to-day operations. Further, as we continue to expand our business operations to different regions of the world outside of Bermuda, we are increasingly subject to new and
additional regulations with respect to our operations, including, for example, laws relating to anti-corruption and anti-bribery, which have received
increased scrutiny in recent years. U.S. laws and
regulations that may be applicable to us in certain circumstances include the economic trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control as well as certain laws administered by the U.S. Department of State. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit corrupt payments
or improper gifts to non-U.S. governments or officials. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our business and/or reputation could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory regimes and changes to accounting rulesmay adversely impact financial results irrespective of businessoperations. Accounting standards and regulatory changes may require modifications to our accounting principles, both prospectively and for prior periods, and such

and restrictions on the transfer of personal data. Any of these effects of
Brexit, and others which cannot be anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition."
Item 1a,RisksRelated to Taxation,"U.S. taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries is subject to U.S. corporate income tax, as a result of
changes in lawsor regulations, or otherwise.
If the IRS were to contend successfully that we or one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries is engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., each entity
engaged in a U.S. trade or business would, to the extent not exempted from tax by the U.S.-Bermuda income tax treaty, be subject to U.S. corporate
income tax on the portion of its net income treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, as well as the U.S. corporate branch profits
tax. If we or one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries were ultimately held to be subject to taxation, our earnings would correspondingly decline.
In addition, benefits of the U.S.-Bermuda income tax treaty which may limit any tax to income attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by
one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries in the U.S. are only available to a subsidiary if more than 50% of its shares are beneficially owned, directly or
indirectly, by individuals who are Bermuda residents or U.S. citizens or residents. Our Bermuda subsidiaries may not be able to continually satisfy, or
establish to the IRS that they satisfy, this beneficial ownership test. Finally, it is unclear whether the U.S.-Bermuda income tax treaty (assuming
satisfaction of the beneficial ownership test) applies to income other than premium income, such as investment income.
While we have maintained our rigorous tax-related operating protocols during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that ongoing severe travel
restrictions may give rise to substantial operating challenges should current conditions persist.
Recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, aswell aspossible future tax reform legislation and regulations, could reduce our access to capital, decrease demand for our products and services, impact our shareholdersor investors in our joint venturesor other entitieswe manage or otherwise adversely affect us.
U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Bill”), was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Bill
amends a range of U.S. federal tax rules applicable to individuals, businesses and international taxation, including, among other things, by altering the
current taxation of insurance premiums ceded from a United States domestic corporation to any non-U.S. affiliate. For example, the Tax Bill includes a
new base erosion anti-avoidance tax (the “BEAT”) that would have substantially altered the taxation of affiliate reinsurance between our operating
affiliates which are subject to U.S. taxation and our non-U.S. affiliates which are not. We believe those transactions would have become economically
unfeasible under the BEAT and terminated them as of the 2017 year end. While these transactions were not significant for us, on an industry-wide basis
for specific market participants the impacts could be more material, and it is possible that over time the BEATmay result in increased prices for certain reinsurance or insurance products, which could cause a decrease in demand for these products and services due to limitations on the available resources of our clients or their underlying insureds.
The Tax Bill increased the likelihood that we or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any entity managed by us will be deemed a “controlled foreign
corporation” (“CFC”) within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code for U.S. federal tax purposes. Specifically, the Tax Bill expands the definition of
“U.S. shareholder” for CFC purposes to include “U.S. persons” (as defined herein) who own 10% or more of the value of a foreign corporation’s shares,
rather than only looking to voting power held. As a result, the “voting cut-back” provisions included in our Bye-laws that limit the voting power of any
shareholder to 9.9% of the total voting power of our capital stock will be ineffective in avoiding “U.S. shareholder” status for U.S. persons who own 10% or
more of the value of our shares. The Tax Bill also expands certain attribution rules for stock ownership in a way that would cause foreign subsidiaries in a
foreign parented group that includes at least one U.S. subsidiary to be treated as CFCs. In the event a corporation is characterized as a CFC, any “U.S.
shareholder” of the CFC is required to include its pro rata share of certain insurance and related investment income in income for a taxable year, even if
such income is not distributed. In addition, U.S. tax exempt entities subject to the unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) rules that own 10% or
more of the value of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or other entities managed by us that are characterized as CFCs may recognize UBTI with respect to such
investment.
In addition to changes in the CFC rules, the Tax Bill contains modifications to certain provisions relating to passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”)
status that could, for example, discourage U.S. persons from investing in our joint ventures or other entities we manage. The Tax Bill makes it more
difficult for a non-U.S. insurance company to avoid PFIC status under an exception for certain non-U.S. insurance companies engaged in the active
conduct of an insurance business. The Tax Bill limits this exception to a non-U.S. insurance company that would be taxable as an insurance company if
it were a U.S. corporation and that maintains insurance liabilities of more than 25% of such company’s assets for a taxable year (or, alternatively,
maintains insurance liabilities that at least equal 10% of its assets, is predominantly engaged in an insurance business and it satisfies a facts and
circumstances test that requires a showing that the failure to exceed the 25% threshold is due to runoff-related or rating-related circumstances).
Further, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS issued certain final and proposed regulations in 2020 that are intended to clarify the application of this insurance
company exception to the classification of a non-U.S. insurer as a PFIC and provide guidance on a range of issues relating to PFICs, including the
application of the look-through rule, the treatment of income and assets of certain U.S. insurance subsidiaries for purposes of the look-through rule and
the extension of the look-through rule to 25% or more owned partnerships. The 2020 regulations define insurance liabilities for purposes of the reserve
test, tighten the reserve test and the statutory cap on insurance liabilities and provide guidance on the runoff-related and rating-related circumstances for
purposes of qualifying as a qualifying insurance corporation under the alternative test (including tightening the scope of non-U.S. insurers that can qualify
for the rating-related circumstances test). The 2020 regulations also propose that a non-U.S. insurer will qualify for the insurance company exception
only if a factual requirements test or an active conduct percentage test is satisfied. The factual requirements test will be met if the non-U.S. insurer’s
officers and employees perform its substantial managerial and operational activities on a regular and continuous basis with respect to its core functions
and virtually all of the active decision making functions relevant to underwriting on a contract-by-contract basis (taking into account activities of officers
and employees of certain related entities in certain cases). The active conduct percentage test will be satisfied if (1) the total costs incurred by the non-
U.S. insurer with respect to its officers and employees (including officers and employees of certain related entities) for services related to core functions
(other than investment activities) equal at least 50% of the total costs incurred for all such services and (2) the non-U.S. insurer’s officers and employees
oversee any part of the non-U.S. insurer’s core functions, including investment management, that are outsourced to an unrelated party. Services provided
by officers and employees of certain related entities are only taken into account in the numerator of the active conduct percentage if the non-U.S. insurer
exercises regular oversight and supervision over such services and compensation arrangements meet certain requirements. The 2020 regulations also
propose that a non-U.S. insurer with no or a nominal number of employees that relies exclusively or almost exclusively upon independent contractors
(other than certain related entities) to perform its core functions and certain insurance securitization vehicles and insurance-linked securities funds will
not be treated as engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business. While we believe that we should not be characterized as a PFIC for the foreseeable future, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in future years. There is a significant risk that joint venture entities managed by us may be characterized as PFICs as there is a significant risk that they may not satisfy the reserve test contained in the final 2020 regulations or the factual requirements or active conduct percentage tests if those tests contained in the proposed 2020 regulations are finalized in their current form.
We are unable to predict all of the ultimate impacts of the Tax Bill and other proposed tax reform regulations and legislation on our business and results
of operations. It is possible the IRS will construe the intent of the Tax Bill as having been to reduce or eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of
companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the U.S., and its interpretation, enforcement actions or regulatory changes
could increase the impact of the Tax Bill beyond prevailing current assessments or our own estimates. Further, it is possible that other legislation could
be introduced and enacted in the future that would have an adverse impact on us. These events and trends towards more punitive taxation of cross
border transactions could in the future materially adversely impact the insurance and reinsurance industry and our own results of operations by
increasing taxation of certain activities and transactions in our industry. Accordingly, we cannot reliably estimate what the potential impact of any such
changes could be to us or our non-U.S. subsidiaries or any other entities managed by us and our and their respective sources of capital, investors or the
market generally, however, it is possible these changes could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
The OECD and the EU may pursue measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income and increase our reporting
requirements.
The OECD has published reports and launched a global dialog among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition.
These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of jurisdictions perceived by the OECD to be tax havens or offering preferential tax
regimes. The OECD has not listed Bermuda as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because Bermuda has committed to eliminating harmful tax
practices and to embracing international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for
financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity. We are not able to predict what changes will arise from the
commitment to the OECD or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes. In 2017, the EU initiated similar measures and identified certain
jurisdictions, including Bermuda, which it considered had tax systems that facilitated offshore structuring by attracting profits without commensurate
economic activity. The EU did temporarily add Bermuda to its “blacklist” of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes between March 2019 and May
2019, when Bermuda adopted economic substance legislation that the EU deemed compliant with its requirements. There were no immediate regulatory,
tax, trade or other legal impacts to RenaissanceRe, but we are not able to predict future EU actions.
In addition, in 2015, the OECD published its final series of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) reports related to its attempt to coordinate
multilateral action on international tax rules. The actions recommended in the BEPS report include an examination of the definition of a “permanent
establishment” and the rules for attributing profits to a permanent establishment, tightening up transfer pricing rules to ensure that outcomes are in line
with value creation, neutralizing the effect of hybrid financial instruments, limiting the deductibility of interest costs for tax purposes and preventing double
tax treaty abuse. Any changes in the tax law of a country in response to the BEPS reports and recommendations could subject us to additional taxes
and increase the complexity and cost of tax compliance.
In May 2019, the OECD published a “Programme of Work,” divided into two pillars, which is designed to address the tax challenges created by an
increasingly digitalized economy. Pillar One addresses the broader challenge of a digitalized economy and focuses on the allocation of group profits
among taxing jurisdictions based on a market-based concept rather than historical “permanent establishment” concepts. Pillar Two addresses the
remaining BEPS risk of profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions by introducing a global minimum tax and a proposed tax on base eroding
payments, which would operate through a denial of a deduction or imposition of source-based taxation (including withholding tax) on certain payments.
The OECD published detailed blueprints of its proposals on October 14, 2020 and public consultations have already been held virtually in January 2021.
The OECD's stated aim is to bring the process to a successful conclusion by mid-2021. To date, the proposal has been written broadly enough to
potentially apply to our group’s activities, and we are unable to determine at this time whether it would have a material adverse impact on our operations
and results.","U.S. taxing authorities could contend that one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries is subject to U.S. corporate income tax, as a result of
changes in lawsor regulations, or otherwise. If we or one or more of our Bermuda subsidiaries were ultimately held to be subject to taxation, our earnings would correspondingly decline. Our Bermuda subsidiaries may not be able to continually satisfy, or

more of the value of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or other entities managed by us that are characterized as CFCs may recognize UBTI with respect to such
investment. In addition to changes in the CFC rules, the Tax Bill contains modifications to certain provisions relating to passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”)
status that could, for example, discourage U.S. persons from investing in our joint ventures or other entities we manage. The Tax Bill limits this exception to a non-U.S. insurance company that would be taxable as an insurance company if
it were a U.S. corporation and that maintains insurance liabilities of more than 25% of such company’s assets for a taxable year (or, alternatively,

principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends,
which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance, and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior
performance over time. The principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income, investment income and fee income generated by our third-party capital
management business.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance, and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries,
with whom we have cultivated strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance
since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of several initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded
and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products, and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business. We also
pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit, which has responsibility for creating and managing our joint ventures and managed
funds, executing structured reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk, and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk
other than catastrophe reinsurance. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new
joint ventures or managed funds, or the acquisition of, or the investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies.
We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property
reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain entities managed by our ventures unit, and (2) Casualty and
Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain entities
managed by our ventures unit.
To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and managed funds, and underwriting
platforms around the world. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures
and managed funds and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through Syndicate 1458 and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Syndicate
1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses, and also writes business through delegated authority
arrangements. The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty
segment results as appropriate.
A meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. Our
results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these
events. We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover, which primarily impact our Property
segment, in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial
results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses 
occurring around the world. Our Casualty and Specialty business, which represents approximately half of our gross written premiums annually, is an efficient 
use of capital that is generally less correlated with our property lines of business. It allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range 
of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative
changes on our operations. We have created and managed, and continue to manage, multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may
create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us
to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could
result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity
increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.
Our revenues are principally derived from three sources: (1) net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell; (2) net investment
income and realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we
sell; and (3) fees and other income received from our joint ventures and managed funds, advisory services and various other items.
Our expenses primarily consist of: (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell; (2) acquisition costs
which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write; (3) operating expenses which primarily consist of personnel expenses, rent and other
operating expenses; (4) corporate expenses which include certain executive, legal and consulting expenses, costs for research and development,
transaction and integration-related expenses, and other miscellaneous costs, including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company;
(5) redeemable noncontrolling interests, which represent the interests of third parties with respect to the net income of DaVinciRe, Medici and Vermeer;
and (6) interest and dividend costs related to our debt and preference shares. We are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate.
Since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has
historically been minimal. In the future, our net tax exposure may increase as our operations expand geographically, or as a result of adverse tax
developments.
The underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio,
underwriting expense ratio, and combined ratio. The net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred
by net premiums earned. The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses (acquisition expenses and operational
expenses) by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A
combined ratio below 100% indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% indicates
unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. We also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on a current accident
year basis and a prior accident years basis. The current accident year net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking current accident year
net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned. The prior accident years net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by
taking prior accident years net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned.","We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance
solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland,
the U.K. and the U.S. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S.,
RREAG, Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and Syndicate 1458. In addition, through RenaissanceRe Medici, we invest in various insurance-based investment instruments that have
returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing
and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management,
investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles, and keeping our promises. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new

Item 7,COVID-19 Pandemic,"In late 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus emerged and has since spread globally. It is not yet possible to give an estimate of all of the
Company’s potential reinsurance, insurance or investment exposures, or any other effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our results of
operations or financial condition. Due to the ongoing and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition, including our potential loss exposures.
We approach estimation of our potential loss exposure by dividing our exposures into three categories: (1) event-like losses, such as event contingency,
event-based casualty class and certain types of accident and health, (2) developing losses, such as traditional casualty lines, financial credit lines, such
as mortgage and trade credit and surety, and (3) known unknowns, which is primarily business interruption. We continue to evaluate industry trends and 
our potential exposure associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and expect historically significant industry losses to emerge over time as the full 
impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized. A longer or more severe recession will increase the probability of losses. Potential
legislative, regulatory and judicial actions are also causing significant uncertainty with respect to policy coverage and other issues. Among other things,
we continue to actively monitor information received from or reported by clients, brokers, industry actuaries, regulators, courts, and others, and to
assess that information in the context of our own portfolio.
In addition to coverage exposures, volatility in global financial markets, together with low or negative interest rates, reduced liquidity and a slowdown in
global economic conditions in many economies, have impacted, and may affect, our investment portfolio in the future. These conditions may also
negatively impact our ability to access liquidity and capital markets financing, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. 
While we believe we have been able to operate effectively with most of our employees working remotely, an extended period of remote work
arrangements could strain the Company’s business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and
adversely affect the Company’s ability to manage our business. For additional information see ""—Current Outlook"" and ""Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors.""","We approach estimation of our potential loss exposure by dividing our exposures into three categories: (1) event-like losses, such as event contingency,

Item 7,General Description,"We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim
expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and
administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. We establish our claims and
claim expense reserves by taking case reserves, adding estimates for IBNR and, if deemed necessary, adding costs for additional case reserves which
represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts which we believe may not be adequately estimated by the client as of that date, or
adequately covered in the application of IBNR. Our reserving committee, which includes members of our senior management, reviews, discusses, and
assesses the reasonableness and adequacy of the reserving estimates included in our audited financial statements.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed
liabilities based on their fair values. These assets and liabilities include TMR’s claims and claim expense reserves, which totaled $2.4
billion at March 22, 2019, and consisted of $783.3 million and $1.6 billion included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments, respectively.
Our reserving methodology for each line of business uses a loss reserving process that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate settlement and
administration costs for claims and claim expenses. We do not calculate a range of estimates and do not discount any of our reserves for claims and
claim expenses. We use this point estimate, along with paid claims and case reserves, to record our best estimate of additional case reserves and IBNR
in our consolidated financial statements. Under GAAP, we are not permitted to establish estimates for catastrophe claims and claim expense reserves
until an event occurs that gives rise to a loss.
Reserving for our claims involves other uncertainties, such as the dependence on information from ceding companies, the time lag inherent in reporting
information from the primary insurer to us or to our ceding companies, and different reserving practices among ceding companies. The information
received from ceding companies is typically in the form of bordereaux, broker notifications of loss and/or discussions with ceding companies or their
brokers. This information may be received on a monthly, quarterly or transactional basis and normally includes paid claims and estimates of case
reserves. We may also receive an estimate or provision for IBNR from certain ceding companies. This information is often updated and adjusted from
time to time during the loss settlement period as new data or facts in respect of initial claims, client accounts, industry or event trends may be reported
or emerge in addition to changes in applicable statutory and case laws.
Our estimates of large losses are based on factors including currently available information derived from claims information from certain customers and
brokers, industry assessments of losses, proprietary models, and the terms and conditions of our contracts. The uncertainty of our estimates for large
losses is also impacted by the preliminary nature of the information available, the magnitude and relative infrequency of the loss, the expected duration of
the respective claims development period, inadequacies in the data provided to the relevant date by industry participants, the potential for further
reporting lags or insufficiencies and, in certain cases, the form of the claims and legal issues under the relevant terms of insurance and reinsurance
contracts. In addition, a significant portion of the net claims and claim expenses associated with certain large losses can be concentrated with a few
large clients and therefore the loss estimates for these losses may vary significantly based on the claims experience of those clients. The contingent
nature of business interruption and other exposures will also impact losses in a meaningful way, which we believe may give rise to significant complexity
in respect of claims handling, claims adjustment and other coverage issues, over time. Given the magnitude of certain losses, there can be meaningful
uncertainty regarding total covered losses for the insurance industry and, accordingly, several of the key assumptions underlying our loss estimates.
Loss reserve estimation in respect of our retrocessional contracts poses further challenges compared to directly assumed reinsurance. In addition, our
actual net losses may increase if our reinsurers or other obligors fail to meet their obligations.
Because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above, we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions
and estimates, and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses in the last several
years. However, there is no assurance that this favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses will occur in future periods.
Our reserving techniques, assumptions and processes differ among our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. Refer to “Note 8. Reserve for
Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the
reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year development of the reserve for claims

Item 7,Premiums and Related Expenses,"Premiums are recognized as income, net of any applicable reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased, over the terms of the related contracts
and policies. Premiums written are based on contract and policy terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and
ceding companies. Unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of contracts and policies in force.
Amounts are computed by pro rata methods based on statistical data or reports received from ceding companies. Reinstatement premiums are
estimated after the occurrence of a loss and are recorded in accordance with the contract terms based upon paid losses as well as reported and
estimated reserves. Reinstatement premiums are earned when written.
Due to the nature of reinsurance, ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums to us subsequent to the contract coverage
period. Consequently, premiums written and receivable include amounts reported by the ceding companies, supplemented by our estimates of premiums
that are written but not reported. The estimation of written premiums may be affected by early cancellation, election of contract provisions for cut-off and 
return of unearned premiums or other contract disruptions. The time lag involved in the process of reporting premiums is shorter than the lag
in reporting losses. In addition to estimating premiums written, we estimate the earned portion of premiums written which is subject to judgment and
uncertainty. Any adjustments to written and earned premiums, and the related losses and acquisition expenses, are accounted for as changes in
estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made.
Lines of business that are similar in both the nature of their business and estimation process may be grouped for purposes of estimating premiums.
Premiums are estimated based on ceding company estimates and our own judgment after considering factors such as: (1) the ceding company's
historical premium versus projected premium, (2) the ceding company's history of providing accurate estimates, (3) anticipated changes in the
marketplace and the ceding company's competitive position therein, (4) reported premiums to date and (5) the anticipated impact of proposed
underwriting changes. Estimates of premiums written and earned are based on the selected ultimate premium estimate, the terms and conditions of the
reinsurance contracts and the remaining exposure from the underlying policies. We evaluate the appropriateness of these estimates in light of the actual
premium reported by the ceding companies, information obtained during audits and other information received from ceding companies.
We estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each premiums receivable based on the
counterparty’s credit ratings. The percentages applied are based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies and are then
adjusted by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates. We then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current
expected credit losses based on other qualitative and judgmental factors. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s premiums receivable balance was $2.9
billion (2019 - $2.6 billion). Of the Company’s premiums receivable balance as of December 31, 2020, the majority are receivables from highly rated
counterparties and Lloyd’s syndicates. In regard to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company held a provision for current expected credit losses on its
premiums receivable of $6.0 million.","Premiums are recognized as income, net of any applicable reinsurance or retrocessional coverage purchased, over the terms of the related contracts
and policies. Unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of contracts and policies in force. Reinstatement premiums are

counterparty’s credit ratings. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s premiums receivable balance was $2.9
billion (2019 - $2.6 billion)."
Item 7,Reinsurance Recoverable,"We enter into retrocessional reinsurance agreements in order to help reduce our exposure to large losses and to help manage our risk portfolio.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related
assumed reinsurance. For multi-year retrospectively rated contracts, we accrue amounts (either assets or liabilities) that are due to or from our
retrocessionaires based on estimated contract experience. If we determine that adjustments to earlier estimates are appropriate, such adjustments are
recorded in the period in which they are determined.
The estimate of reinsurance recoverable can be more subjective than estimating the underlying claims and claim expense reserves as discussed under
the heading “Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” above. In particular, reinsurance recoverable may be affected by deemed inuring reinsurance, industry
losses reported by various statistical reporting services, and other factors. Reinsurance recoverable on dual trigger reinsurance contracts require us to
estimate our ultimate losses applicable to these contracts as well as estimate the ultimate amount of insured industry losses that will be reported by the
applicable statistical reporting agency, as per the contract terms. In addition, the level of our additional case reserves and IBNR reserves has a
significant impact on reinsurance recoverable. These factors can impact the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverable to be recorded.
The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until some point in the future. The amounts recoverable that will
ultimately be collected are subject to uncertainty due to the ultimate ability and willingness of reinsurers to pay our claims at a future point in time, for
reasons including insolvency or elective run-off, contractual dispute and various other reasons. In addition, because the majority of the balances
recoverable will not be collected for some time, economic conditions as well as the financial and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may
change, and these changes may affect the reinsurer’s willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligations to us. To reflect these uncertainties,
we estimate and record a provision for current expected credit losses for potential uncollectible reinsurance recoverable which reduces reinsurance
recoverable and net income.
We estimate our provision for current expected credit losses by applying specific percentages against each reinsurance recoverable based on our
counterparty’s credit rating. The percentages applied are based on historical industry default statistics developed by major rating agencies and are then adjusted 
by us based on industry knowledge and our judgment and estimates. We then evaluate the overall adequacy of the provision for current expected credit losses 
based on other qualitative and judgmental factors.
At December 31, 2020, our reinsurance recoverable balance was $2.9 billion (2019 - $2.8 billion). Of this amount, 45.2% is fully collateralized by our
reinsurers, 53.4% is recoverable from reinsurers rated A- or higher by major rating agencies and 1.4% is recoverable from reinsurers rated lower than A-
by major rating agencies (2019 - 57.5%, 41.0% and 1.5%, respectively). The reinsurers with the three largest balances accounted for 15.3%, 10.8% and
6.7%, respectively, of our reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2020 (2019 - 12.7%, 7.2% and 7.0%, respectively). The provision for current
expected credit losses recorded against reinsurance recoverable was $6.3 million at December 31, 2020 (2019 - $7.3 million). The three largest
company-specific components of the provision for current expected credit losses represented 13.2%, 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively, of our total provision
for current expected credit losses at December 31, 2020 (2019 - 18.1%, 7.9% and 7.2%, respectively).","Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims and claim expense reserves associated with the related

expected credit losses recorded against reinsurance recoverable was $6.3 million at December 31, 2020 (2019 - $7.3 million)."
Item 7,Fair Value,"The use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our consolidated financial
statements. Fair value is defined under accounting guidance currently applicable to us to be the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between open market participants at the measurement date. We recognize the change in unrealized
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations.
FASB ASC Topic Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures prescribes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the respective valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable (Level 3).
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value
hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement of the asset or liability. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability.
In order to determine if a market is active or inactive for a security, we consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the volume of trading
activity for the security in question, the price of the security compared to its par value (for fixed maturity investments), and other factors that may be
indicative of market activity.
At December 31, 2020, we classified $81.2 million and $7.6 million of our assets and liabilities, respectively, at fair value on a recurring basis using
Level 3 inputs. This represented 0.3% and 0.0% of our total assets and liabilities, respectively. Level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation
techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. These measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little, if
any, market activity for the asset or liability. We use valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual
terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs, some of which may
be unobservable, to value these Level 3 assets and liabilities.
Refer to “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information about fair value
measurements.","The use of fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities with resulting unrealized gains or losses is pervasive within our consolidated financial
statements. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2020, we classified $81.2 million and $7.6 million of our assets and liabilities, respectively, at fair value on a recurring basis using

Item 7,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, finite lived other intangible assets are
amortized over their estimated useful life, subject to impairment, and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost
or fair value, subject to impairment. If goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, they are written down to their estimated fair values with a
corresponding expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed
liabilities based on their fair values. We recognized identifiable finite lived intangible assets of $11.2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted
average period of 10.5 years, identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets of $6.8 million, and certain other adjustments to the fair values of the assets
acquired, liabilities assumed and shareholders’ equity of TMR at March 22, 2019, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019.
In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment
at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). Goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired
entities giving rise to the goodwill and other intangible assets.
We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For purposes of the annual impairment evaluation, we assess qualitative
factors to determine if events or circumstances exist that would lead us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then
we do not perform a quantitative evaluation. Should we determine that a quantitative analysis is required, we will first determine the fair value of the
reporting unit and compare that with the carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then goodwill
is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then proceed to
determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, we
identify the reporting unit or business entity that the goodwill or other intangible asset is attributed to, and review historical and forecasted operating and
financial performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions. Other assumptions used could produce
significantly different results which may result in a change in the value of goodwill or our other intangible assets and a related charge in our consolidated
statements of operations. An impairment charge could be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the implied fair value of those operations
where the goodwill or other intangible assets are applicable. In the event we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired, an accounting
charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.
As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company determined that indefinite lived
intangible assets of $6.8 million, recognized in relation to the acquisition of TMR, should be written down to $Nil. The Company recorded an intangible
asset impairment charge of $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information with respect to the impairment.
As at December 31, 2020, excluding the amounts recorded in investments in other ventures, under the equity method, as noted below, our consolidated
balance sheets include $211.0 million of goodwill (2019 - $210.7 million) and $38.6 million of other intangible assets (2019 - $51.6 million). Impairment
charges related to these balances were $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $Nil, 2018 - $Nil). In the future, it is possible we
will hold more goodwill and intangible assets, which would increase the degree of judgment and uncertainty embedded in our financial statements, and
potentially increase the volatility of our reported results.","Subsequent to initial recognition, finite lived other intangible assets are
amortized over their estimated useful life, subject to impairment, and goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost
or fair value, subject to impairment. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic Business Combinations, we allocated the total consideration paid for TMR among acquired assets and assumed
liabilities based on their fair values. In addition, we recognized goodwill of $13.1 million, based on foreign exchange rates on March 22, 2019, attributable to the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the net assets of TMR. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of TMR will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment
at least annually, as outlined below (more frequently if certain indicators are present). Should we determine that a quantitative analysis is required, we will first determine the fair value of the

is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. Principally, we

charge will be taken in the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in
the period in which the impairment charge is recorded. As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company determined that indefinite lived
intangible assets of $6.8 million, recognized in relation to the acquisition of TMR, should be written down to $Nil. The Company recorded an intangible
asset impairment charge of $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020."
Item 7,Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired (“VOBA”),"VOBA was initially recorded to reflect the establishment of the value of business acquired asset in connection with the acquisition of TMR, which
represents the estimated present value of the expected underwriting profit within the unearned premiums liability, net of reinsurance, less costs to
service the related policies and a risk premium. VOBA is derived using, among other things, estimated loss ratios by line of business to calculate the
underwriting profit, weighted average cost of capital, risk premium and expected payout patterns. The adjustment for VOBA will be amortized to
acquisition expenses over approximately two years, as the contracts for business in-force as of the acquisition date expire.","VOBA was initially recorded to reflect the establishment of the value of business acquired asset in connection with the acquisition of TMR, which
represents the estimated present value of the expected underwriting profit within the unearned premiums liability, net of reinsurance, less costs to
service the related policies and a risk premium."
Item 7,"Investments in Other Ventures, Under Equity Method","Investments in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in other ventures,
under equity method, and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share of income or
loss from such investments in our results for the period. Any decline in the value of investments in other ventures, under equity method, including
goodwill and other intangible assets arising upon acquisition of the investee, considered by management to be other-than-temporary, is reflected in our
consolidated statements of operations in the period in which it is determined. As of December 31, 2020, we had $98.4 million (2019 - $106.5 million) in
investments in other ventures, under equity method on our consolidated balance sheets, including $10.6 million of goodwill and $12.4 million of other
intangible assets (2019 - $10.6 million and $14.3 million). The carrying value of our investments in other ventures, under equity method, individually or in
the aggregate, may, and likely will, differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so.
In determining whether an equity method investment is impaired, we take into consideration a variety of factors including the operating and financial
performance of the investee, the investee’s future business plans and projections, recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded
companies where available, discussions with the investee’s management, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers in value.
Accordingly, we make assumptions and estimates in assessing whether an impairment has occurred and if, in the future, our assumptions and
estimates made in assessing the fair value of these investments change, this could result in a material decrease in the carrying value of these
investments. This would cause us to write-down the carrying value of these investments and could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations in the period the impairment charge is taken. We do not have any current plans to dispose of these investments, and cannot assure you we
will consummate future transactions in which we realize the value at which these holdings are reflected in our financial statements. We have not
recorded any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our investments in other ventures,
under the equity method in any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. See “Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” in our “Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.","Any decline in the value of investments in other ventures, under equity method, including

to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information."
Item 7,Income Taxes,"Income taxes have been provided in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from
temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Such
temporary differences are primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards and GAAP versus tax basis accounting differences relating to unearned
premiums, reserves for claims and claim expenses, deferred finance charges, deferred underwriting results, accrued expenses, investments, deferred
acquisition expenses, intangible assets, amortization and depreciation and VOBA. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change in tax rates is enacted. A valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded
if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized.
At December 31, 2020, our net deferred tax asset (prior to our valuation allowance) and valuation allowance were $138.0 million (2019 - $119.6 million)
and $88.7 million (2019 - $75.7 million), respectively. See “Note 15. Taxation” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information. At each balance sheet date, we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more
likely than not that all, or some portion, of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance assessment is performed separately 
in each taxable jurisdiction based on all available information including projections of future GAAP taxable income from each tax-paying component in 
each tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance relates to a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions in which we do business. 
It excludes Bermuda and our U.S. operations that existed prior to the acquisition of TMR, which only have a small valuation allowance against finite lived 
tax carryforwards.
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $Nil as of December 31, 2020 (2019 - $Nil). Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, would be
recognized in income tax expense. At December 31, 2020, interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were $Nil (2019 - $Nil).
The following filed income tax returns are open for examination with the applicable tax authorities: tax years 2017 through 2019 with the IRS; 2016
through 2019 with Ireland; 2018 through 2019 with the U.K.; 2016 through 2019 with Singapore; 2019 with Switzerland; and 2016 through 2019 with
Australia. We do not expect the resolution of these open years to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial
condition.","Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from

Item 7,Underwriting Results by Segment,"In 2020, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $568.2 million, or 23.4%, to $3.0 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019.
Gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business were $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $291.3 million, or 18.3%, compared to 2019. The
increase in gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business in 2020 was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions,
certain new transactions, rate improvements and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
Gross premiums written in our other property class of business were $1.1 billion in 2020, an increase of $276.8 million, or 33.1%, compared to 2019. The
increase in gross premiums written in our other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities
across a number of our underwriting platforms, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.
In 2019, our Property segment gross premiums written increased by $670.1 million, or 38.1%, to $2.4 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in 2018.
Gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business were $1.6 billion in 2019, an increase of $246.1 million, or 18.2%, compared to 2018. The
increase in gross premiums written in our catastrophe class of business was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions, certain
new transactions, rate improvements, and the acquisition of TMR.
Gross premiums written in our other property class of business were $835.5 million in 2019, an increase of $423.9 million, or 103.0%, compared to 2018.
The increase in gross premiums written in our other property class of business was primarily driven by growth across our underwriting platforms, both
from existing relationships and through new opportunities we believe have comparably attractive risk-return attributes, rate improvements, and business acquired in
connection with the acquisition of TMR.
As our other property class of business has become a larger percentage of our Property segment gross premiums written, the amount of proportional
business has increased. Proportional business typically has relatively higher premiums per unit of expected underwriting income, together with a higher
acquisition expense ratio and combined ratio, than traditional excess of loss reinsurance.
Our Property segment gross premiums written continue to be characterized by a large percentage of U.S. and Caribbean premium, as we have found
business derived from exposures in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world to be, in general, less attractive on a risk-adjusted basis during recent
periods. A significant amount of our U.S. and Caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms, notably U.S. Atlantic windstorms, as well as
earthquakes and other natural and man-made catastrophes.
Ceded premiums written in our Property segment increased $185.2 million, to $961.9 million, in 2020, compared to $776.7 million in 2019. The increase
in ceded premiums written was principally due to certain of the gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business noted above being ceded to
third-party investors in our managed vehicles, primarily RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd., as well as an overall increase in ceded purchases as part of
the Company’s gross-to-net strategy.
Ceded premiums written in our Property segment increased $71.0 million, to $776.7 million, in 2019, compared to $705.7 million in 2018. The increase in
ceded premiums written was principally due to a significant portion of the increase in gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business noted
above being ceded to third-party investors in our managed vehicles, in particular Upsilon Fund, as well as an overall increase in ceded purchases.
Due to the potential volatility of the reinsurance contracts which we sell, we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses and to help
manage our risk portfolio. To the extent that appropriately priced coverage is available, we anticipate continued use of retrocessional reinsurance to
reduce the impact of large losses on our financial results and to manage our portfolio of risk; however, the buying of ceded reinsurance in our Property
segment is based on market opportunities and is not based on placing a specific reinsurance program each year. In addition, in future periods, we may
utilize the growing market for insurance-linked securities to expand our purchases of retrocessional reinsurance if we find the pricing and terms of such
coverages attractive.
Our Property segment generated underwriting income of $11.2 million in 2020, compared to $209.3 million in 2019, a decrease of $198.1 million. In 2020,
our Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 74.2%, an underwriting expense ratio of 25.2% and a combined ratio of 99.4%,
compared to 59.3%, 27.8% and 87.1%, respectively, in 2019.
Principally impacting the Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2020 were the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events, which
resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $651.9 million and added 35.0 percentage points to the combined ratio, and COVID-19
losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $235.0 million and added 12.3 percentage points to the combined ratio.
Partially offsetting the impact of the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years
of $157.3 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded
recoveries. This favorable development reduced the Property segment combined ratio by 8.1 percentage points. In comparison, 2019 was principally
impacted by the 2019 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $414.4 million and a
corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 26.7 percentage points.
Our Property segment generated underwriting income of $209.3 million in 2019, compared to $262.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $52.8 million. In 2019,
our Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 59.3%, an underwriting expense ratio of 27.8% and a combined ratio of 87.1%,
compared to 47.4%, 27.7% and 75.1%, respectively, in 2018.
Principally impacting the Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2019 were the 2019 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net
negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $414.4 million and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of
26.7 percentage points. In comparison, 2018 was impacted by the 2018 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting
result of $338.7 million, and a corresponding increase in the combined ratio of 37.4 percentage points. This was partially offset by a net positive impact
on the underwriting result associated with changes in the estimates of the net negative impact on the underwriting result of the 2017 Large Loss Events
of $145.7 million, and a corresponding decrease in the combined ratio of 14.0 percentage points.
In addition, in 2019, net favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses of $2.9 million, or a decrease in the combined
ratio of 0.2 percentage points, was primarily driven by favorable development on the 2017 Large Loss Events, which was mostly offset by adverse
development on the 2018 Large Loss Events, compared to net favorable development of $221.3 million, or 21.0 percentage points, in 2018. The net
favorable development in 2018 included the decreases in the estimates of the net negative impact of the 2017 Large Loss Events noted above. Refer to
“Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—
Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” and “Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional discussion of our reserving techniques and prior year development of net claims and claim expenses.
In 2020, our Casualty and Specialty segment gross premiums written increased by $430.3 million, or 18.1%, to $2.8 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in
2019. The increase was due to growth from new and existing business opportunities written in the current period and prior periods across various classes
of business within the segment, and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.
In 2019, our Casualty and Specialty segment gross premiums written increased by $827.3 million, or 53.4%, to $2.4 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in
2018. The increase in gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment was primarily due to growth from new and existing business
opportunities written in the current and prior periods across various classes of business within the segment, and business acquired in connection with
the acquisition of TMR.
Our relative mix of business between proportional business and excess of loss business has fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to do so in the
future. Proportional business typically has relatively higher premiums per unit of expected underwriting income, together with a higher combined ratio,
than traditional excess of loss reinsurance. In addition, proportional coverage tends to be exposed to relatively more attritional, and frequent, losses,
while being subject to less expected severity.
Ceded premiums written in our Casualty and Specialty segment increased by $98.4 million, to $747.9 million, in 2020, compared to $649.5 million in
2019, primarily resulting from increased gross premiums written subject to our retrocessional quota share reinsurance programs.
Ceded premiums written in our Casualty and Specialty segment increased by $176.7 million, to $649.5 million, in 2019, compared to $472.8 million in
2018, primarily resulting from increased gross premiums written subject to our retrocessional quota share reinsurance programs.
As in our Property segment, the buying of ceded reinsurance in our Casualty and Specialty segment is based on market opportunities and is not based
on placing a specific reinsurance program each year.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.5 million in 2020, compared to underwriting income of $46.0 million in 2019.
The underwriting loss in 2020 was driven by the COVID-19 losses. In 2020, our Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim
expense ratio of 73.8%, an underwriting expense ratio of 30.5% and a combined ratio of 104.3%, compared to 66.1%, 31.2% and 97.3%, respectively, in
2019.
The increase in the combined ratio in 2020 was principally driven by net claims and claim expenses associated with the COVID-19 losses of $122.1
million, which added 6.1 percentage points to the net claims and claim expense ratio during 2020.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment experienced net favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses of $26.8 million, or
1.4 percentage points, during 2020, compared to $23.9 million, or 1.4 percentage points, respectively, in 2019. The net favorable development during
2020 and 2019 was principally driven by reported losses coming in lower than expected. Refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” and
“Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of our reserving
techniques and prior year development of net claims and claim expenses.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $46.0 million in 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $17.0 million in 2018.
In 2019, our Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 66.1%, an underwriting expense ratio of 31.2% and a
combined ratio of 97.3%, compared to 67.3%, 34.5% and 101.8%, respectively, in 2018.
The decrease in the Casualty and Specialty segment combined ratio in 2019 was primarily driven by an improved underwriting expense ratio as well as
an overall decrease in the net claims and claims expense ratio. The decrease in the net claims and claim expense ratio was principally due to lower
current accident year losses, which reduced the net claims and claim expense ratio by 5.1 percentage points in 2019, as compared to 2018 which was
adversely impacted by liability exposures associated with the wildfires in California in 2018. The underwriting expense ratio in the Casualty and Specialty
segment decreased 3.3 percentage points to 31.2% in 2019, compared to 34.5% in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio as
a result of improved operating leverage.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment experienced net favorable development on prior accident years net claims and claim expenses of $23.9 million, or
1.4 percentage points, during 2019, compared to $49.3 million, or 5.3 percentage points, respectively, in 2018. The net favorable development during

and cash and securities in amounts which fluctuate over time. We therefore rely on dividends and distributions (and other statutorily permissible
payments) from our subsidiaries, investment income and fee income to meet our liquidity requirements, which primarily include making principal and
interest payments on our debt and dividend payments to our preference and common shareholders.
The payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is, under certain circumstances, limited by the applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions
in which our subsidiaries operate, including Bermuda, the U.S., the U.K., Switzerland, Australia, Singapore and Ireland. In addition, insurance laws
require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. We believe that each of our insurance subsidiaries and
branches exceeded the minimum solvency, capital and surplus requirements in their applicable jurisdictions at December 31, 2020. Certain of our
subsidiaries and branches are required to file FCRs, with their regulators, which provide details on solvency and financial performance. Where required,
these FCRs will be posted on our website. The regulations governing our and our principal operating subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and to maintain
certain measures of solvency and liquidity and requirements to file FCRs are discussed in detail in “Part I, Item 1. Business—Regulation” and “Note 18.
Statutory Requirements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”","Its assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries

certain measures of solvency and liquidity and requirements to file FCRs are discussed in detail in “Part I, Item 1. Statutory Requirements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”"
Item 7,Holding Company Liquidity,"RenaissanceRe’s principal uses of liquidity are: (1) common share related transactions including dividend payments to our common shareholders and
common share repurchases, (2) preference share related transactions including dividend payments to our preference shareholders and preference share
redemptions, (3) interest and principal payments on debt, (4) capital investments in our subsidiaries, (5) acquisition of new or existing companies or
businesses, such as our acquisition of TMR and (6) certain corporate and operating expenses.
We attempt to structure our organization in a way that facilitates efficient capital movements between RenaissanceRe and our operating subsidiaries and
to ensure that adequate liquidity is available when required, giving consideration to applicable laws and regulations, and the domiciliary location of
sources of liquidity and related obligations.
In the aggregate, our principal operating subsidiaries have historically produced sufficient cash flows to meet their expected claims payments and
operational expenses and to provide dividend payments to us. In addition, our subsidiaries maintain a concentration of investments in high quality liquid
securities, which management believes will provide additional liquidity for extraordinary claims payments should the need arise. However, in some
circumstances, RenaissanceRe may contribute capital to its subsidiaries. For example, during 2018 and 2017 we experienced significant losses from
large catastrophe events, and as we would expect following events of this magnitude, it was necessary for RenaissanceRe to contribute capital to certain
of our principal operating subsidiaries to ensure they were able to maintain levels of capital adequacy and liquidity in compliance with various laws and
regulations, support rating agency capital requirements, pay valid claims quickly and be adequately capitalized to pursue business opportunities as they
arise. During 2019, RenaissanceRe contributed capital to RenaissanceRe Specialty Holdings to fund the acquisition of TMR and made a capital
contribution to Renaissance Reinsurance to increase its shareholders’ equity, consistent with past practice following a significant acquisition and to
support growth in premiums. In 2020, RenaissanceRe contributed capital to RREAG to support growth in premiums. In addition, from time to time we
invest in new managed joint ventures or managed funds, increase our investments in certain of our managed joint ventures or managed funds and
contribute cash to investment subsidiaries. In certain instances, we are required to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries, for example,
Renaissance Reinsurance is obligated to make a mandatory capital contribution of up to $50.0 million in the event that a loss reduces Top Layer Re’s
capital below a specified level.","RenaissanceRe’s principal uses of liquidity are: (1) common share related transactions including dividend payments to our common shareholders and
common share repurchases, (2) preference share related transactions including dividend payments to our preference shareholders and preference share
redemptions, (3) interest and principal payments on debt, (4) capital investments in our subsidiaries, (5) acquisition of new or existing companies or

capital below a specified level."
Item 7, Sources of Liquidity,"Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting primarily of premiums, investment income and fee income, have provided sufficient funds to pay
the losses and operating expenses incurred by our subsidiaries and to fund dividends and distributions to RenaissanceRe. Other potential sources of
liquidity include borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of securities. For example, in June 2020, we raised $1.1 billion of net proceeds in an
underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement of our common shares.
The premiums received by our operating subsidiaries are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to
such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses generally are received within the first two years of inception of a contract, while operating expenses
are generally paid within a year of being incurred. It generally takes much longer for net claims and claims expenses incurred to be reported and
ultimately settled, requiring the establishment of reserves for claims and claim expenses and losses recoverable. Therefore, the amount of net claims
paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net claims and claims expenses incurred in that year, as reported in the consolidated
statement of operations.
While we expect that our liquidity needs will continue to be met by our cash receipts from operations, as a result of the combination of current market
conditions, lower than usual investment yields, and the nature of our business where a large portion of the coverages we provide can produce losses of
high severity and low frequency, future cash flows from operating activities cannot be accurately predicted and may fluctuate significantly between
individual quarters and years. In addition, due to the magnitude and complexity of certain large loss events, meaningful uncertainty remains regarding
losses from these events and our actual ultimate net losses from these events may vary materially from preliminary estimates, which would impact our
cash flows from operations. Further, we expect historically significant industry losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic to emerge over time as the full
impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized, which may impact our cash flows from operations.
Our “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act allows for the public offering of various types of securities, including common
shares, preference shares and debt securities, and thus provides a source of liquidity. Because we are a “well-known seasoned issuer” as defined by the
rules promulgated under the Securities Act, we are also eligible to file additional automatically effective registration statements on Form S-3 in the future
for the potential offering and sale of additional debt and equity securities.","Other potential sources of
liquidity include borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of securities. The premiums received by our operating subsidiaries are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to
such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses generally are received within the first two years of inception of a contract, while operating expenses

conditions, lower than usual investment yields, and the nature of our business where a large portion of the coverages we provide can produce losses of
high severity and low frequency, future cash flows from operating activities cannot be accurately predicted and may fluctuate significantly between
individual quarters and years."
Item 7,Capital Resources,"We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and seek to adjust our capital according to the needs of our business. In particular, we require
capital sufficient to meet or exceed the capital adequacy ratios established by rating agencies for maintenance of appropriate financial strength ratings,
the capital adequacy tests performed by regulatory authorities and the capital requirements under our credit facilities. We may seek to raise additional
capital or return capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and cash dividends (or a combination of such methods). In the normal
course of our operations, we may from time to time evaluate additional share or debt issuances given prevailing market conditions and capital management strategies, including for our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds. In addition, as noted above, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to obtain letter of credit facilities for the benefit of our operating subsidiaries and certain of our joint
ventures in their reinsurance and insurance business.","We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis and seek to adjust our capital according to the needs of our business. In the normal
course of our operations, we may from time to time evaluate additional share or debt issuances given prevailing market conditions and capital management strategies, including for our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds."
Item 7,Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses,"We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim
expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and
administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. Our actual net claims and
claim expenses paid will differ, perhaps materially, from the estimates reflected in our financial statements, which may adversely impact our financial
condition, liquidity and capital resources.
Refer to “Note 8. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we
insure and reinsure, the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year
development of the reserve for claims and claim expenses, analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each
of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” for more information on the reserving
techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, our current estimates versus our initial estimates
of our claims reserves, and sensitivity analysis for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments.","We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves.

Item 7,Investments,"Our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital, market liquidity, and diversification of risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our investments are
subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In addition to the information presented above and
below, refer to “Note 5. Investments” and “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information regarding our investments and the fair value measurement of our investments, respectively.
As the reinsurance coverages we sell include substantial protection for damages resulting from natural and man-made catastrophes, as well as for
potentially large casualty and specialty exposures, we expect from time to time to become liable for substantial claim payments on short notice.
Accordingly, our investment portfolio as a whole is structured to seek to preserve capital and provide a high level of liquidity, which means that the large
majority of our investment portfolio consists of highly rated fixed income securities, including U.S. treasuries, agencies, highly rated sovereign and
supranational securities, high-grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We also have an allocation to publicly
traded equities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as equity investments trading and an allocation to other investments (including catastrophe
bonds, private equity investments, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds).","Investments” and “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional

majority of our investment portfolio consists of highly rated fixed income securities, including U.S. treasuries, agencies, highly rated sovereign and
supranational securities, high-grade corporate securities and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities."
Item 7,Fixed Maturity Investments and Short Term Investments,"At December 31, 2020, our fixed maturity investments and short term investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted average credit quality rating of AAA
(2019 – AA) and a weighted average effective yield of 0.9% (2019 – 2.1%). At December 31, 2020, our non-investment grade and not rated fixed maturity
investments totaled $1.4 billion or 10.0% of our fixed maturity investments (2019 - $828.2 million or 7.4%, respectively).
In addition, within our other investments category we have funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and non-
investment grade cat-linked securities. At December 31, 2020, the funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and
non-investment grade cat-linked securities totaled $911.4 million (2019 – $816.3 million).
At December 31, 2020, we had $5.0 billion of short term investments (2019 – $4.6 billion). Short term investments are managed as part of our investment
portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased. Short term investments are carried at fair value. The increase in our allocation to short
term investments at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, is principally driven by the additional invested assets in certain of our
managed joint ventures and managed funds that limit investment allocation to shorter term securities.
The duration of our fixed maturity investments and short term investments at December 31, 2020 was 2.9 years (2019 - 2.9 years). From time to time,
we may reevaluate the duration of our portfolio in light of the duration of our liabilities and market conditions.
The value of our fixed maturity investments will fluctuate with changes in the interest rate environment and when changes occur in economic conditions
or the investment markets. Additionally, our differing asset classes expose us to other risks which could cause a reduction in the value of our
investments. Examples of some of these risks include:
Changes in the overall interest rate environment can expose us to “prepayment risk” on our mortgage-backed investments. When interest rates
decline, consumers will generally make prepayments on their mortgages and, as a result, our investments in mortgage-backed securities will be
repaid to us more quickly than we might have originally anticipated. When we receive these prepayments, our opportunities to reinvest these
proceeds back into the investment markets will likely be at reduced interest rates. Conversely, when interest rates increase, consumers will
generally make fewer prepayments on their mortgages and, as a result, our investments in mortgage-backed securities will be repaid to us less
quickly than we might have originally anticipated. This will increase the duration of our portfolio, which is disadvantageous to us in a rising interest
rate environment.
Our investments in mortgage-backed securities are also subject to default risk. This risk is due in part to defaults on the underlying securitized
mortgages, which would decrease the fair value of the investment and be disadvantageous to us. Similar risks apply to other asset-backed securities
in which we may invest from time to time.
Our investments in debt securities of other corporations are exposed to losses from insolvencies of these corporations, and our investment portfolio
can also deteriorate based on reduced credit quality of these corporations. We are also exposed to the impact of widening credit spreads even if
specific securities are not downgraded.
Our investments in asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risks, as noted above, and to the structural risks of these securities. The
structural risks primarily emanate from the priority of each security in the issuer’s overall capital structure. We are also exposed to the impact of
widening credit spreads.
Within our other investments category, we have funds that invest in non-investment grade fixed income securities as well as securities denominated
in foreign currencies. These investments expose us to losses from insolvencies and other credit-related issues and also to widening of credit
spreads. We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may result in realized losses to us if our exposures are not hedged or if
our hedging strategies are not effective.","At December 31, 2020, our non-investment grade and not rated fixed maturity
investments totaled $1.4 billion or 10.0% of our fixed maturity investments (2019 - $828.2 million or 7.4%, respectively). In addition, within our other investments category we have funds that invest in non-investment grade and not rated fixed income securities and non-

Item 7,Equity InvestmentsTrading,"We have a diversified public equity securities mandate with a third-party investment manager which currently comprises a portion of our investments
included in equity investments trading. In addition, we can also strategically invest in certain more concentrated public equity positions internally,
primarily through our ventures unit. It is possible our equity allocation will increase in the future, and it could, from time to time, have a material effect on
our financial results for the reasonably foreseeable future.
The Company’s equity investments trading includes the Company’s strategic investment portfolio, which is subject to a variety of risks including:
company performance, the availability of strategic investment opportunities, and macro-economic, industry, and systemic risks of the equity markets
overall. Consequently, the carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio will vary over time as the value or size of the Company’s portfolio of
strategic investments in marketable equity securities fluctuates.","We have a diversified public equity securities mandate with a third-party investment manager which currently comprises a portion of our investments
included in equity investments trading. Consequently, the carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio will vary over time as the value or size of the Company’s portfolio of
strategic investments in marketable equity securities fluctuates."
Item 7,Other Investments,"We account for our other investments at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic Financial Instruments. The fair value of certain of our fund
investments, which principally include private equity funds, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds, is recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet in other investments, and is generally established on the basis of the net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments, if
applicable. The net valuation criteria established by the managers of such investments is established in accordance with the governing documents of
such investments. Many of our fund investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales which are determined by the governing documents
and limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term.
Some of our fund managers and fund administrators are unable to provide final fund valuations as of our current reporting date. We typically experience a
reporting lag to receive a final net asset value report of one month for our hedge funds and senior secured bank loan funds and three months for private
equity funds, although we have occasionally experienced delays of up to six months at year end, as the private equity funds typically complete their
year-end audits before releasing their final net asset value statements.
In circumstances where there is a reporting lag between the current period end reporting date and the reporting date of the latest fund valuation, we
estimate the fair value of these funds by starting with the prior month or quarter-end fund valuations, adjusting these valuations for actual capital calls,
redemptions or distributions, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and then estimating the return for the current period. In circumstances in
which we estimate the return for the current period, all information available to us is utilized. This principally includes using preliminary estimates
reported to us by our fund managers, estimating returns based on the performance of broad market indices, or other valuation methods, where
necessary. Actual final fund valuations may differ, perhaps materially so, from our estimates and these differences are recorded in our consolidated
statement of operations in the period in which they are reported to us, as a change in estimate. Included in net realized and unrealized gains on
investments for 2020 is a loss of $2.4 million (2019 - loss of $5.5 million) representing the change in estimate during the period related to the difference
between our estimated fair value due to the lag in reporting, as discussed above, and the actual amount as reported in the final net asset values provided
by our fund managers.
Our estimate of the fair value of catastrophe bonds is based on quoted market prices, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or
underwriter bid indications. Refer to “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information
regarding the fair value measurement of our investments.
We have committed capital to private equity investments, other investments and investments in other ventures of $1.8 billion, of which $809.0 million has
been contributed at December 31, 2020. Our remaining commitments to these investments at December 31, 2020 totaled $1.0 billion. In the future, we
may enter into additional commitments in respect of private equity investments or individual portfolio company investment opportunities.","The fair value of certain of our fund

Item 7,General Economic Conditions and the COVID-19 Pandemic,"At the recent January 1 renewals, we were able to grow with existing and new customers across both of our segments and all of our platforms. We fully
deployed the $1.1 billion of capital raised in our June 2020 equity offerings into our underwriting portfolio. We also raised and deployed significant
additional capital within our joint venture and managed fund businesses. As we have grown, we have broadened our access to risk, writing more lines of
business on more platforms. We have diversified our sources of capital through various owned and managed balance sheets as well as equity, debt and
insurance-linked securities markets. This has afforded us significant flexibility to react when the world changes.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had immense impacts on a global scale, including on the insurance and reinsurance industries where it has raised many
new questions and challenges for us and our industry. While we believe that we can continue to execute on our strategic plan and compete for, and
meet, the demand for the protection that we provide, it is difficult to predict all of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets in
which we participate and our ability to effectively respond to these changing market dynamics.
In particular, we believe the stresses in the global economy will continue and that this may result in increased market volatility. Also, the ongoing period
of low interest rates may affect our ability to derive investment income from our investments. The effects of this trend could be magnified for longer-tail
business lines that are more inflation sensitive, particularly in our Casualty and Specialty segment, and in our other property class of business within our
Property segment. Notwithstanding the many uncertainties and challenges that lie ahead, we believe that our track record of responding to industry events, differentiated risk management and client service capabilities, and access to diverse sources of both capital and risk position us favorably in the current environment.","At the recent January 1 renewals, we were able to grow with existing and new customers across both of our segments and all of our platforms.

Notwithstanding the many uncertainties and challenges that lie ahead, we believe that our track record of responding to industry events, differentiated risk management and client service capabilities, and access to diverse sources of both capital and risk position us favorably in the current environment."
Item 7,Reinsurance Market Trends and Developments,"Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, rates were rising across most lines of business. This was due in part to back-to-back years of natural
disaster losses between 2017 and 2020 from multiple hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires and earthquakes. The pandemic has accelerated an increasingly
attractive market across property as well as casualty and specialty lines. We believe that these market conditions have created significant opportunities
to source attractive risk in the lines of business that we write, and that we believe will result in superior returns for our shareholders. Our experience at
the recent January 1 renewals was consistent with this trend – we observed rate increases and found many attractive opportunities to grow with both
existing and new customers. We believe that the markets in which we participate will continue to harden in 2021, and we plan to continue to seek to
take advantage of additional opportunities throughout the year.
Compared to prior years, we believe that the overall global supply of reinsurance capital was broadly flat. For the most part, the investment portfolios of
our customers and competitors rebounded from losses earlier in the year, and losses to underwriting results were primarily limited to the erosion of
earnings rather than any significant capital impairment. The market experienced additional new capital inflows with several start-ups targeting the
retrocession and excess and surplus markets, as well as equity and debt raises which were mostly in support of existing players. Growth in traditional
capital remained flat while alternative capital likely declined modestly year-on-year, largely driven by a reduction in the collateralized reinsurance market.
The catastrophe bond market continues to grow, with record primary issuances in 2020. Concerns over trapped collateral, particularly associated with
COVID-19 business interruption claims, were less pronounced than expected. However, there remains material uncertainty over the true extent of
COVID-19 claims and the potential for material losses in the future.
Property. Heading into the January 1 renewals, we expected the retrocessional and U.S. property catastrophe markets to provide us with significant
opportunities. While the retrocession and property catastrophe reinsurance markets evidenced some strengthening, they ultimately were not as strong
as the market expected. We believe that this was a result of additional capital available for underwriting as a result of a disconnect between investment
portfolios and the financial reality of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic recession, as well as elevated supply from new capital and increasing
amounts of released collateral. Despite this, rates were still up, and we found many opportunities to grow our portfolio on favorable terms, particularly in
our other property line of business.
Casualty and Specialty. The January 1 renewal in our Casualty and Specialty segment exceeded our expectations, and we saw favorable opportunities
in various classes of business across this segment. We anticipate that dislocation in several of these classes of business will continue to provide
opportunities in 2021. We think that our prior work building strong relationships with key customers allowed us to gain superior access to desirable
business.
See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,” for additional information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-

Item 7a,Equity Price Risk,"Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the market value of equities. As detailed in the table below, we are directly exposed to this
risk through our investment in equity investments trading, including certain positions in our strategic investment portfolio, which are traded on nationally
recognized stock exchanges; and indirectly exposed to this risk through our investments in: (1) private equity investments whose exit strategies often
depend on the equity markets; and (2) other ventures, under equity method. We may, from time to time, use equity derivatives in our investment portfolio
to either assume equity risk or hedge our equity exposure.","As detailed in the table below, we are directly exposed to this

Item 7a,QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK,"The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from sensitivities presented are forward-looking statements of market
risk assuming certain market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things,
actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, derivatives and product offerings. The
results of analysis used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events or losses. Refer to “Note On Forward-
Looking Statements” for additional discussion regarding forward-looking statements included herein.
We are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk; foreign currency risk; credit risk; and equity price risk. Our policies to address
these risks in 2020 were not materially different than those used in 2019.
The ongoing and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a longer or more severe recession, which may increase the probability
of credit losses in our investment portfolio. Volatility in global financial markets, together with low or negative interest rates, reduced liquidity and a
slowdown in global economic conditions may adversely affect our investment portfolio. Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, including
with respect to reinsurance brokers, customers and retrocessionaires, which may materially increase to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic affects our
ability to collect premiums receivable or reinsurance recoverable.
Our investment guidelines permit, subject to approval, investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, foreign currency forward contracts
and swap agreements, which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes. Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to derivatives we have entered into.","The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from sensitivities presented are forward-looking statements of market

Looking Statements” for additional discussion regarding forward-looking statements included herein. We are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk; foreign currency risk; credit risk; and equity price risk. Our policies to address
these risks in 2020 were not materially different than those used in 2019."
Item 7a,Interest Rate Risk,"Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security to changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments and short
term investments, whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Our liabilities are accrued at a static rate in accordance with GAAP.
However, we consider our liabilities, namely our net claims and claims expenses, to have an economic exposure to inflation and interest rate risk. As a
result, we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our overall net economic asset position and more generally from an accounting standpoint
since the assets are carried at fair value, while liabilities are accrued at a static rate.
We may utilize derivative instruments via interest rate overlay strategies, for example, to manage or optimize our duration and treasury curve exposures.
In addition, we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our fixed maturity investments portfolio to fund operations, pay reinsurance and insurance
liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events.","Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity investments and short
term investments, whose fair values will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Our liabilities are accrued at a static rate in accordance with GAAP. However, we consider our liabilities, namely our net claims and claims expenses, to have an economic exposure to inflation and interest rate risk."
Item 7a,Foreign Currency Risk,"Our functional currency for consolidated reporting purposes is the U.S. dollar. We routinely write a portion of our business in currencies other than U.S.
dollars and invest a portion of our cash and investment portfolio in those currencies. In addition, certain of our entities have non-U.S. dollar functional
currencies. As a result, we may experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our consolidated financial statements. We are primarily impacted by
the foreign currency risk exposures noted below, and may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to minimize the
effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information related to foreign currency forward and option contracts we have entered into.
Our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts for notional
values that approximate the foreign currency liabilities, including claims and claim expense reserves and reinsurance balances payable, net of any cash,
investments and receivables held in the respective foreign currency. Our use of foreign currency forward and option contracts is intended to minimize the
effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with our underwriting operations. We
may determine not to match a portion of our projected underwriting related assets or liabilities with underlying foreign currency exposure with
investments in the same currencies, which would increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and potentially increase the impact and volatility
of foreign exchange gains and losses on our results of operations.
Our investment portfolio is exposed to currency fluctuations through our investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed maturity investments, short term
investments and other investments. To economically hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations from these investments, we may enter into foreign
currency forward contracts. In certain instances, we may assume foreign exchange risk as part of our investment strategy. Realized and unrealized
foreign exchange gains or losses from the sale of our non-U.S. dollar fixed maturity investments trading and other investments, and foreign exchange
gains or losses associated with our hedging of these non-U.S. dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange (losses) gains in our consolidated
statements of operations. In the future, we may choose to increase our exposure to non-U.S. dollar investments.","We routinely write a portion of our business in currencies other than U.S.
dollars and invest a portion of our cash and investment portfolio in those currencies. Our foreign currency policy with regard to our underwriting operations is generally to enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts for notional

gains or losses associated with our hedging of these non-U.S. dollar investments are recorded in net foreign exchange (losses) gains in our consolidated
statements of operations."
Item 7a,Credit Risk,"Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to make timely payments in accordance with contractual terms of the instrument or
contract and market risk associated with changes in credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to direct credit risk within our portfolios of fixed maturity
and short term investments, and through customers and reinsurers in the form of premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverable, respectively, as
discussed below.
Credit risk related to our fixed maturity investments and short term investments is the exposure to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of individual
investment holdings, issuers, groups of issuers, industries and countries. We manage credit risk in our fixed maturity investments and short term
investments through credit research performed primarily by our investment management service providers and our evaluation of these investment
managers adherence to investment mandates provided to them. The management of credit risk in the investment portfolio is integrated in our credit risk
governance framework and the management of credit exposures and concentrations within the investment portfolio are carried out in accordance with our
risk policies, limits and risk concentrations as overseen by the Investment and Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. In the investment
portfolio, we review on a regular basis our asset concentration, credit quality and adherence to credit limit guidelines. At December 31, 2020, our fixed
maturity investments and short term investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted average credit quality rating of AAA (2019 - AA). In addition, we limit the
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and, except for the securities of the U.S. Government and U.S. Government related entities,
and money market securities, none of our fixed-maturity and short-term investments exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020.
We also employ credit derivatives in our investment portfolio to either assume credit risk or hedge our credit exposure. At December 31, 2020, we had
outstanding credit derivatives of $Nil in notional positions to hedge credit risk and $96.8 million in notional positions to assume credit risk, denominated
in U.S. dollars (2019 - $0.5 million and $143.4 million, respectively). Refer to “Note 19. Derivative Instruments” in our “Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements” for additional information related to credit derivatives entered into by us. The aggregate hypothetical market value impact from an immediate
upward shift in credit spreads of 100 basis points would cause a decrease in the market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately
$1.6 million at December 31, 2020. Conversely, the aggregate hypothetical market value impact from an immediate downward shift in credit spreads of
100 basis points would cause an increase in the market value of our net position in these derivatives of approximately $1.6 million at December 31, 2020. For an immediate downward shift in credit spreads, we do not allow credit spreads to go negative in calculating the impact. The foregoing reflects the use of an immediate time
horizon, since this presents the worst-case scenario.
Premiums receivable from ceding companies and reinsurance recoverable from our reinsurers are subject to credit risk. To mitigate credit risk related to
reinsurance premiums receivable, we have established standards for ceding companies and, in most cases, have a contractual right of offset allowing us
to settle claims net of any reinsurance premiums receivable. To mitigate credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverable amounts, we consider the
financial strength of our reinsurers when determining whether to purchase coverage from them. We generally obtain reinsurance coverage from
companies rated “A-“ or better by S&P unless the obligations are collateralized. We routinely monitor the financial performance and rating status of all
material reinsurers. Refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary","We manage credit risk in our fixed maturity investments and short term

Item 1,General,"PartnerRe Ltd., incorporated in Bermuda in August 1993, is the ultimate holding company for our international reinsurance and insurance group (collectively, the Company, PartnerRe or we). The Company predominantly provides reinsurance and certain specialty insurance lines on a worldwide basis through its principal wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Partner Reinsurance Company Ltd. (PartnerRe Bermuda), Partner Reinsurance Europe SE (PartnerRe Europe), Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. (PartnerRe U.S.) and, effective April 1, 2015, as discussed below, Partner Reinsurance Asia Pte. Ltd. (PartnerRe Asia). Risks reinsured include, but are not limited to, property, casualty, motor, agriculture, aviation/space, catastrophe, credit/surety, engineering, energy, marine, specialty property, specialty casualty, multiline and other lines, mortality, longevity, accident and health and alternative risk products. The Company’s alternative risk products include weather and credit protection to financial, industrial and service companies on a worldwide basis.
In 1997, recognizing the limitation of a monoline strategy, the Company shifted its strategic focus to become a leading multiline reinsurer. In July 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of SAFR (subsequently renamed PartnerRe SA and reinsurance business transferred into PartnerRe Europe), a well-established global professional reinsurer based in Paris. In December 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of the reinsurance operations of Winterthur Re, further enhancing the Company’s expansion strategy. In December 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of PARIS RE Holdings Limited (Paris Re), a French-listed, Swiss-based holding company and its operating subsidiaries. This acquisition provided the Company with enhanced strategic and financial flexibility in a less predictable and more limited growth environment.
Effective December 31, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Presidio Reinsurance Group, Inc. (subsequently renamed and referred herein as PartnerRe Health), a California-based United States (U.S.) specialty accident and health reinsurance and insurance writer. The Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows include PartnerRe Health’s results from January 1, 2013.
In January 2015, the Company announced that PartnerRe Asia, a wholly owned subsidiary of PartnerRe Ltd., was licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to operate as a non-life and life reinsurer in Singapore. As of April 1, 2015, PartnerRe Asia will be the principal reinsurance carrier for the Company’s business underwritten in the Asia Pacific region. The establishment of PartnerRe Asia will enable the Company’s Asian reinsurance operations to be consolidated into one regional, well-capitalized entity and supports its growing underwriting presence in the region.
On January 25, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (the Amalgamation Agreement) with Axis Capital Holdings Limited, a Bermuda exempted company (AXIS), pursuant to which the Company will amalgamate with AXIS (the Amalgamation) and the two companies will continue as a single Bermuda exempted company (the Amalgamated Company). The transaction, which is structured as a merger of equals, has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Under the terms of the Amalgamation Agreement, the Company’s shareholders will receive 2.18 shares of the Amalgamated Company’s common shares for each share of the Company’s common shares they own and AXIS’ shareholders will receive one share of the Amalgamated Company’s common shares for each share of AXIS’ common shares they own. Upon completion of the transaction, shareholders of the Company and shareholders of AXIS will own approximately 51.6 percent and 48.4 percent of the Amalgamated Company, respectively. The Amalgamated Company’s headquarters will be located in Bermuda. This transaction is expected to provide the Company with an opportunity to enter the primary insurance market, benefit from increased scale and enhanced market presence and to achieve substantial benefits related to capital efficiencies, expense savings and business synergies. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2015, subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies, regulatory clearances and customary closing conditions. Both companies will continue to operate as two independent entities until all such approvals are obtained. In connection with the Amalgamation, Costas Miranthis stepped down as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company and as a member of the Company's Board effective January 25, 2015. At that time, David Zwiener, a member of the Company's Board, assumed the position of interim CEO of the Company until completion of the Amalgamation. Under the terms of the Amalgamation Agreement, the Company suspended its share repurchase program until completion of the Amalgamation. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein, all discussions in this report are with respect to PartnerRe Ltd. as a standalone entity.","PartnerRe Ltd., incorporated in Bermuda in August 1993, is the ultimate holding company for our international reinsurance and insurance group (collectively, the Company, PartnerRe or we).

Item 1,Business Strategy,"The Company is in the business of assessing and assuming risk for an appropriate return. The Company creates value through its ability to understand, evaluate, diversify and distribute risk. Its strategy is founded on a capital-based risk appetite and the selected risks that Management believes will allow the Company to meet its goals for appropriate profitability and risk management within that appetite. Management believes that this construct allows the Company to balance cedants’ need for confidence of claims payment with its shareholders’ need for an appropriate return on their capital. Compound annual growth in diluted tangible book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding plus dividends is the prime metric used by Management to measure the Company’s performance. Other important measures include operating earnings or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders, operating earnings or loss per common share and common share equivalents outstanding (diluted operating earnings or loss per share), operating return on beginning diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding (Operating ROE) and Group Adjusted Return on Equity (Group AROE). These measures are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See Key Financial Measures in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a detailed discussion of the key measures used by the Company to evaluate its financial performance, including definitions and basis of calculation.
The Company has adopted the following five-point strategy:
We are diversified across products and insurance markets: PartnerRe writes most lines of reinsurance and writes selected specialty insurance lines of business to further diversify its earnings stream and to provide access to risks that position the Company for future growth. Management believes diversification is a competitive advantage, which increases return per unit of risk, provides access to risk worldwide and reduces the overall volatility of results. Diversification is also the cornerstone of the Company’s risk management approach. The (re)insurance business is cyclical, but cycles by line of business and by geography are rarely synchronized.
We have an appetite for risk provided it helps us deliver superior risk-adjusted returns: PartnerRe’s products address accumulation risks, complex coverage issues and large exposures faced by clients. The Company’s book of business is focused on severity lines of business such as casualty, catastrophe, specialized property and aviation. The Company is willing to assume such above average risk, but only if the pricing implies significantly above average risk-adjusted returns. The Company’s diversification enables it to assume risks that are individually large for our clients, but are more easily diversified within PartnerRe’s portfolio. The Company also writes frequency lines of business such as standard property, motor and life, which have historically provided modestly lower levels of returns with less volatility.
We manage our capital to optimize long-term returns while maintaining an appropriate risk profile: PartnerRe’s business is cyclical and the Company responds to that reality. The Company seeks to manage its capital to optimize shareholder returns over the reinsurance cycle, but it will not unbalance the portfolio by writing only the business that offers the highest return at any point in time. In order to manage capital appropriately across a portfolio and over a reinsurance cycle, the Company believes two things are critical: an appropriate and common measure of risk-adjusted performance and the ability and willingness to redeploy capital for its most efficient and effective use, either within the business or by returning capital to shareholders. To achieve effective and efficient capital allocation, the Company uses Operating ROE as a portfolio management tool, supported by strong actuarial and financial analysis.
We create value through superior risk evaluation and intelligent portfolio and relationship management: The Company’s technical underwriting, actuarial and portfolio management skills enable the Company to create value by understanding, valuing, diversifying, and distributing risk. The Company’s objective is overall portfolio profitability. The aim is not to select a few highly profitable transactions in any year, but to build sustainable portfolios that can deliver superior returns over several years. While our primary focus is assuming risk for our own account, we are open to intermediating risk in order to optimize our retained portfolio and enhance overall returns.
We enhance overall returns through prudent financial and investment management and an efficient support framework: Strong underwriting must be complemented with prudent financial management, careful reserving, superior asset management and efficient support in order to achieve the Company’s targeted returns. The Company’s principal business is the assumption of reinsurance and insurance risk and, when selecting asset strategies and support services, the Company’s priority is to support the reinsurance operations. The Company is willing to take some additional risk on its assets if it helps us generate extra return, but this risk-taking is managed so that it will not put at risk the reinsurance operations. We will not use insurance or reinsurance as a means of raising funds to pursue other goals.","The Company is in the business of assessing and assuming risk for an appropriate return.

Item 1,Risk Management,"In the insurance and reinsurance industry, the core of the business model is the assumption and management of risk. A key challenge is to create total shareholder value through the intelligent and optimal assumption and management of reinsurance, insurance and investment risks while limiting and mitigating those risks that can destroy tangible as well as intangible value, those risks for which the organization is not sufficiently compensated, and those risks that could threaten the ability of the Company to achieve its objectives. While many companies start with a return goal, the Company starts with a capital-based risk appetite and then looks for risks that meet its return targets within that framework. Management believes that this construct allows the Company to balance the cedants’ need for certainty of claims payment with the shareholders’ need for an adequate total return.
All business decisions entail a risk/return trade-off, and these decisions are applicable to the Company’s risks. In the context of assumed business risks, this requires an accurate evaluation of risks to be assumed, and a determination of the appropriate economic returns required as fair compensation for such risks. In the context of other than voluntarily assumed business risks, the decision relates to comparing the probability and potential severity of a risk event against the costs of risk mitigation strategies. In many cases, the potential impact of a risk event is so severe as to warrant significant, and potentially expensive, risk mitigation strategies. In other cases, the probability and potential severity of a risk does not warrant extensive risk mitigation.
The Company’s results are primarily determined by how well the Company understands, prices and manages assumed risk. Management also believes that every organization faces numerous risks that could threaten the successful achievement of a company’s goals and objectives. These include all factors which can be viewed as either strategic, financial or operational risks that are common to any industry, such as choice of strategy and markets, economic and business cycles, competition, changes in regulation, data quality and security, fraud, business interruption and management continuity. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
The Company has a clearly defined governance structure for risk management. Executive Management and the Board are responsible for setting the overall vision and goals of the Company, which include the Company’s risk appetite and return expectations. The Company’s risk framework, including key risk policies, is recommended by Executive Management and approved by the Risk and Finance Committee of the Board (Risk and Finance Committee). Each of the Company’s risk policies relates to a specific risk and describes the Company’s approach to risk management, defines roles and responsibilities relating to the assumption, mitigation, and control processes for that risk, and an escalation process for exceptions. Key policies are established by the CEO and operating policies and risk controls at the next level down are established by Business Unit and Support Unit management as appropriate. Key policies are approved by the relevant Committee of the Board. Risk management policies and processes are coordinated by Group Risk Management and compliance is verified by Internal Audit on a periodic basis. The results of audits are monitored by the Audit Committee of the Board.
The Company utilizes a multi-level risk management structure, whereby critical exposure limits, return requirement guidelines, capital at risk and key policies are established by the Executive Management and Board, but day-to-day execution of risk assumption activities and related risk mitigation strategies are delegated to the Business Units and Support Units. Reporting on risk management activities is integrated within the Company’s annual planning process, quarterly operations reports, periodic reports on exposures and large losses, and presentations to the Executive Management and Board. Individual Business Units and Support Units employ, and are responsible for reporting on, operating risk management procedures and controls, while Internal Audit periodically evaluates the effectiveness of such procedures and controls.","While many companies start with a return goal, the Company starts with a capital-based risk appetite and then looks for risks that meet its return targets within that framework.

Item 1,General,"Loss reserves represent estimates of amounts an insurer or reinsurer ultimately expects to pay in the future on claims incurred at a given time, based on facts and circumstances known at the time that the loss reserves are established. It is possible that the total future payments may exceed, or be less than, such estimates. The estimates are not precise in that, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity, frequency and other variable factors such as inflation. During the loss settlement period, it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward. Despite such adjustments, the ultimate future liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates.
As part of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers review historical data and anticipate the impact of various factors such as legislative enactments and judicial decisions that may affect potential losses from casualty claims, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase exposure to losses, mortality and morbidity trends and trends in general economic conditions. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments, is an appropriate basis for anticipating future events.
See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 of Part II of this report for a discussion of the Company’s reserving process.","During the loss settlement period, it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward.

Item 1.,Strategic Risks,"Strategic risks are managed by the CEO and include the direction and governance of the Company, as well as its response to key external factors faced by the reinsurance industry, such as changes in cedants’ risk retention behavior, regulation, competitive structure and macroeconomic, legal and social trends. Management considers that strong governance procedures, including a robust system of processes and internal controls is appropriate to manage risks related to its reputation and risks related to new initiatives, including acquisitions, new products or markets. The Company seeks to preserve its reputation through high professional and ethical standards and manages the impact of identified risks through the adoption and implementation of a sound and comprehensive Assumed Risk Framework.","Management considers that strong governance procedures, including a robust system of processes and internal controls is appropriate to manage risks related to its reputation and risks related to new initiatives, including acquisitions, new products or markets."
Item 1.,Assumed Risks,"Central to the Company’s assumed risk framework is its risk appetite. The Company’s risk appetite is a statement of how much and how often the Company will tolerate economic losses during an annual period. The Company’s risk appetite is expressed as the maximum economic loss that the Board is willing to incur based on both a once in 10 years and a once in 250 years modeled probability. The Company’s risk appetite is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Definitions for the maximum economic loss and available economic capital are as follows:
Economic Loss. The Company defines an economic loss as a decrease in the Company’s economic value, which is defined as common shareholders’ equity attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. plus the “time value of money” discount of the Non-life reserves that is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), net of tax, plus the embedded value of the Life portfolio that is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, net of tax, less goodwill and intangible assets, net of tax.
Available Economic Capital. The Company defines economic capital as the economic value, as defined above, plus preferred shareholders’ equity and the carrying value of debt recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The Maximum Economic Loss. The maximum economic loss is a loss expressed as a percentage of economic capital for both a once in 10 years and a once in 250 years modeled probability.
The Company manages exposure levels from multiple risk sources to provide reasonable assurance that modeled operating or economic losses are contained within the risk appetite approved by the Board. The Company utilizes an internal model to evaluate capital at risk levels and compliance with the Company’s risk appetite. The results of the Company’s assessment of capital at risk levels in relation to the risk appetite are reported to the Board on a periodic basis.
To mitigate the chance of operating losses and economic losses exceeding the risk appetite, the Company relies upon diversification of risk sources and risk limits to manage exposures. Diversification enables losses from one risk source to be offset by profits from other risk sources so that the chance of overall losses exceeding the Company’s risk appetite is reduced. However, if multiple losses from multiple risk sources occur within the same year, there is the potential that operating and economic losses can exceed the risk appetite. In addition, there is the chance that the Company’s internal assessment of capital at risk for a single source of risk or for multiple sources of risk proves insufficient resulting in actual losses exceeding the Company’s risk appetite. To reduce the chance of either of these unfavorable outcomes, the Company uses risk limits to minimize the chance that losses from a single risk source or from multiple risk sources will cause operating losses and economic losses to exceed the Company’s risk appetite.
The Company establishes key risk limits for any risk source deemed by Management to have the potential to cause operating losses or economic losses greater than the Company’s risk appetite. The Company may also establish risk limits for any risk source deemed to have the possibility of causing reputational damage. The Risk and Finance Committee approves the key risk limits. Executive and Business and Support Unit Management may set additional specific and aggregate risk limits within the key risk limits approved by the Risk and Finance Committee. The actual level of risk is dependent on current market conditions and the need for balance in the Company’s portfolio of risks. On a quarterly basis, Management reviews and reports to the Risk and Finance Committee the actual limits deployed against the approved limits.
Individual Business and Support Units manage assumed risks, subject to the appetite and principles approved by the Board, limits approved by the Risk and Finance Committee, and policies established by Executive and Business Unit Management. At an operational level, Business and Support Units manage assumed risk through risk mitigation strategies including strong processes, technical risk assessment and collaboration among different groups of professionals who each contribute a particular area of expertise.

The Company establishes key risk limits for any risk source deemed by Management to have the potential to cause operating losses or economic losses greater than the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk and Finance Committee approves the key risk limits."
Item 1.,Other Underwriting Risk and Exposure Controls,"The Company’s underwriting is conducted at the Business Unit level through specialized underwriting teams with the support of technical staff in disciplines such as actuarial, claims, legal, risk management and finance.
The Company’s underwriters generally speak the local language and/or are native to their country or area of specialization. They develop close working relationships with their ceding company counterparts and brokers through regular visits, gathering detailed information about the cedant’s business and local market conditions and practices. As part of the underwriting process, the underwriters also focus on the reputation and quality of the proposed cedant, the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedant, the geographic area in which the cedant does business and the cedant’s market share, historical loss data for the cedant and, where available, historical loss data for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions, in order to compare the cedant’s historical loss experience to industry averages, and to gauge the perceived insurance and reinsurance expertise and financial strength of the cedant. The Company trains its underwriters extensively and strives to maintain continuity of underwriters within specific geographic markets and areas of specialty.
Given the Company underwrites volatile lines of business, such as catastrophe reinsurance, the operating results and financial condition of the Company can be adversely affected by catastrophes and other large losses that may give rise to claims under reinsurance coverages provided by the Company. The Company manages its exposure to catastrophic and other large losses by (i) limiting its aggregate exposure on catastrophe reinsurance in any particular geographic zone, (ii) selective underwriting practices, (iii) diversification of risks by geographic area and by lines and classes of business, and (iv) by purchasing retrocessional reinsurance.
The Company generally underwrites risks with specified limits per treaty program. Like other reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event such as hurricane, windstorm, tornado, flood or earthquake, or man-made events. Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company’s reinsurance treaties and facultative contracts in one or more lines of business. The Company considers such event scenarios as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events.","The Company’s underwriters generally speak the local language and/or are native to their country or area of specialization.

Like other reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event such as hurricane, windstorm, tornado, flood or earthquake, or man-made events."
Item 1.,"Retrocessional reinsurance
","The Company uses retrocessional reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure on certain reinsurance risks assumed and to mitigate the effect of any single major event or the frequency of medium-sized events. These agreements provide for the recovery of a portion of losses and loss expenses from retrocessionaires. The majority of the Company’s retrocessional reinsurance agreements cover property and specialty lines (e.g., aviation or marine) exposures, predominantly those that are catastrophe exposed. The Company also utilizes retrocessions in the Life and Health segment to manage the amount of per-event and per-life risks to which it is exposed. Retrocessionaires must be pre-approved based on their financial condition and business practices, with stability, solvency and credit ratings being important criteria. Strict limits per retrocessionaire are also put into place and monitored to mitigate counter party credit risk.
The Company remains liable to its cedants to the extent that the retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under retrocessional agreements, and therefore retrocessions are subject to credit risk in all cases and to aggregate loss limits in certain cases. The Company holds collateral, including escrow funds, trusts, securities and letters of credit under certain retrocessional agreements. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible and reinsurance losses recoverable from retrocessionaires are reported after allowances for uncollectible amounts.
In addition to the retrocessional agreements, PartnerRe Europe has a Reserve Agreement in place with Colisée Re (see Business-Reserves-Non-life Reserves-Reserve Agreement in Item 1 of Part I of this report).","The Company uses retrocessional reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure on certain reinsurance risks assumed and to mitigate the effect of any single major event or the frequency of medium-sized events.

Item 1.,Natural Catastrophe Probable Maximum Loss (PML),"The following discussion of the Company’s natural catastrophe probable maximum loss (PML) information contains forward-looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties. See Item 1A of Part I of this report for a list of the Company’s risk factors. Any of these risk factors could result in actual losses that are materially different from the Company’s PML estimates below.
Natural catastrophe risk is a source of significant aggregate exposure for the Company and is managed by setting risk appetite and limits, as discussed above. Natural catastrophe perils can impact geographic regions of varying size and can have economic repercussions beyond the geographic region directly impacted.
The Company considers a peril zone to be an area within a geographic region, continent or country in which losses from insurance exposures are likely to be highly correlated to a single catastrophic event. The Company defines peril zones to capture the vast majority of exposures likely to be incorporated by typical modeled events. There is, however, no industry standard and the Company’s definitions of peril zones may differ from those of other parties.
The Company has exposures in other peril zones that can potentially generate losses greater than the PML estimates below. The Company’s PMLs represent an estimate of loss for a single event for a given return period. The table below discloses the Company’s 1-in-250 and 1-in-500 year return period estimated loss for a single occurrence of a natural catastrophe event in a one-year period. In other words, the 1-in-250 and 1-in-500 year return period PMLs mean that there is a 0.4% and 0.2% chance, respectively, in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe in a specific peril zone will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate.
The PML estimates below include all significant exposure from our Non-life and Life and Health business operations. This includes coverage for property, marine, energy, engineering, workers’ compensation and mortality and exposure to catastrophe from insurance-linked securities. The PML estimates do not include casualty coverage that could be exposed as a result of a catastrophic event. In addition, they do not include estimates for contingent losses to insureds that are not directly impacted by the event (e.g. loss of earnings due to disruption in supply lines).","The following discussion of the Company’s natural catastrophe probable maximum loss (PML) information contains forward-looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties.

Item 1.,Capital Adequacy,"A key challenge for Management is to maintain an appropriate level of capital. Management’s first priority is to hold sufficient capital to meet all of the Company’s obligations to cedants, meet regulatory requirements and support its position as one of the stronger reinsurers in the industry. Holding an excessive amount of capital, however, will reduce the Company’s compound annual growth in diluted tangible book value per share and Operating ROE. Consequently, Management closely monitors its capital needs and capital level throughout the reinsurance cycle and in times of volatility and turmoil in global capital markets, and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the Company’s capital in order to achieve an appropriate balance of financial strength and shareholder returns. Capital management is achieved by either deploying capital to fund attractive business opportunities, or in times of excess capital and times when business opportunities are not so attractive, returning capital to its common shareholders by way of share repurchases and dividends. During 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 5.2 million of its common shares under its authorized share repurchase program at a total cost of $551 million, representing an average cost of $106.30 per share. In addition, the Company increased the quarterly dividends on its common shares by 5% during 2014, from $0.64 per share to $0.67 per share, and a further 4% increase for 2015 from $0.67 per share to $0.70 per share. For further discussion of capital adequacy, see Shareholders' Equity and Capital Resources Management in Item 7 of Part II of this report.","Consequently, Management closely monitors its capital needs and capital level throughout the reinsurance cycle and in times of volatility and turmoil in global capital markets, and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the Company’s capital in order to achieve an appropriate balance of financial strength and shareholder returns.

Item 1.,Liquidity and Cash Flows,"The Company aims to be a reliable and financially secure partner to its cedants. This means that the Company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support its cedants by settling claims quickly. The Company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations. Management believes that a profitable, well-run reinsurance organization will generate sufficient cash from premium receipts to pay claims, acquisition costs and other expenses in most years. To the extent that underwriting cash flows are not sufficient to cover operating cash outflows in any year, the Company may utilize cash flows generated from investments and may ultimately liquidate assets from its investment portfolio. Management ensures that its liquidity requirements are supported by maintaining a high quality, well balanced and liquid investment portfolio, and by matching the duration and currency of its investments and investments underlying the funds held—directly managed account with that of its net reinsurance liabilities. In 2015, the Company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows, absent a series of unusual catastrophic events. For further discussion of liquidity and cash flows, see Shareholders' Equity and Capital Resources Management — Liquidity in Item 7 of Part II of this report.","This means that the Company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support its cedants by settling claims quickly. The Company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations.

Item 1.,Enterprise Culture,"Management is focused on ensuring that the structure and culture of the organization promote intelligent, prudent, transparent and ethical decision-making. Management believes that a sound enterprise culture starts with the tone at the top. Management holds regular company-wide information sessions to present and review Management’s latest decisions, whether operational, financial or structural, as well as the financial results of the Company. Employees are encouraged to address questions related to the Company’s results, strategy or Management decisions, either anonymously or otherwise to Management so that they can be answered during these information sessions. Management believes that these sessions provide a consistent message to all employees about the Company’s value of transparency. Management also strives to promote a work environment that (i) aligns the skill set of individuals with challenges encountered by the Company, (ii) includes segregation of duties to ensure objectivity in decision-making, and (iii) provides a compensation structure that encourages and rewards intelligent risk taking and ethical behavior. To that effect, the Company has a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and provides employees with a direct communication channel to the Audit Committee of the Board in the event they become aware of questionable behavior of Management or any other employee. Finally, Management believes that building a sound internal control environment, including a strong Internal Audit function, helps ensure that behaviors are consistent with the Company’s cultural values.

Item 1.,Regulation,"The business of reinsurance is regulated in all countries in which we operate, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance businesses while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. In certain foreign countries, reinsurers are required to be licensed by governmental authorities. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. The violation of regulatory requirements may result in fines, censures and/or criminal sanctions in various jurisdictions. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
As a holding company, PartnerRe Ltd. is not directly subject to (re)insurance regulations, but its various material operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation as follows:
Bermuda
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the Insurance Act), regulates the insurance business of PartnerRe Bermuda. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. The Insurance Act makes no distinction between insurance and reinsurance business.
PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed as a Class 4 and Class E insurer in Bermuda and is therefore authorized to carry on general and long-term insurance business, respectively. Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Class 4 and Class E insurers such as PartnerRe Bermuda include the following:
Minimum Capital Requirements. The BMA imposes certain minimum capital regulatory requirements on PartnerRe Bermuda, which are to hold statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding the Target Capital Level, which is equivalent to 120% of the Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR). PartnerRe Bermuda’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) should be calculated by either (a) the model developed by the BMA, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. PartnerRe Bermuda currently uses the BMA model in calculating its solvency requirements. The Bermuda risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime provides a risk-based capital model (termed the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR)) as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business;
Solvency Assessment. PartnerRe Bermuda must perform an assessment of its own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self Assessment (CISSA). The CISSA allows the BMA to obtain an insurer’s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess a company’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. In addition, PartnerRe Bermuda must file with the BMA a Catastrophe Risk Return which assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure;
Reporting Requirements. PartnerRe Bermuda must prepare audited annual statutory financial statements and file them with the BMA, together with audited annual financial statements which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); and
Dividends and Distributions. PartnerRe Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit that it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements as described above. In addition, PartnerRe Bermuda must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, by 15% or more.In addition to the above regulatory requirements impacting PartnerRe Bermuda, current international initiatives in the regulation of global insurance and reinsurance groups, such as the European Union’s Solvency II initiative (Solvency II), are trending towards the imposition of group supervisory regimes, introducing one principal “home” regulator over all the operating entities in a particular insurance or reinsurance group (referred to as Group Supervision). The Insurance Act sets out provisions regarding Group Supervision, including the power of the BMA to include or exclude specified entities from Group Supervision, the power of the BMA to withdraw as group supervisor, the functions of the BMA as group supervisor and the power of the BMA to make rules regarding Group Supervision. This Group Supervision regime is in addition to the regulation of the Company’s various operating subsidiaries in their local jurisdictions. The BMA’s Group Supervision rules set out the rules in respect of the assessment of the financial situation and solvency of an insurance group, the system of governance and risk management, and supervisory reporting and disclosures of an insurance group. The group solvency rules set out the rules in respect of the capital and solvency return and enhanced capital requirements for an insurance group. The BMA has chosen PartnerRe Bermuda as the designated insurer for the purposes of Group Supervision, and the BMA will act as group supervisor of the PartnerRe group. As group supervisor, the BMA will gather relevant and essential information on and assess the financial situation of the PartnerRe group, and coordinate the dissemination of such information to other relevant competent authorities for the purposes of assisting in their regulatory functions and the enforcement of regulatory action against the PartnerRe group or any of its members. PartnerRe is not an insurer and, as such, is not regulated in Bermuda. However, pursuant to its functions as group supervisor, the BMA may include any member of the group within its Group Supervision, including PartnerRe.
Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Insurance Groups include the solvency assessment. The PartnerRe group must annually perform an assessment of its own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Group’s Solvency Self Assessment (GSSA). The GSSA allows the BMA to obtain an insurance group’s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess a group’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. In addition, the PartnerRe group must file with the BMA a Catastrophe Risk Return which assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure.
Effective January 1, 2014, the BMA imposed the ECR on the PartnerRe group pursuant to its function as the Company's group supervisor. The PartnerRe group’s ECR may be calculated by either (a) the standard model developed by the BMA, or (b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. PartnerRe currently uses the BMA standard model in calculating its group ECR requirements. In addition, the PartnerRe group is required to prepare and submit annual audited group U.S. GAAP financial statements, annual group statutory financial statements, annual group statutory financial return, annual group capital and solvency return and quarterly group unaudited financial returns.
In addition to the above, PartnerRe Bermuda maintains an operating branch in Canada and representative offices in Chile, China and Mexico. The Canadian branch is subject to regulation in Canada by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. For a further discussion of the regulations pertaining to the Canadian branch see below.
Ireland
The Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank) regulates insurance and reinsurance companies authorized in Ireland, including PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland Insurance Limited (PartnerRe Ireland). PartnerRe Holdings Europe Limited, a holding company for PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland, is not subject to regulation by the Central Bank.
PartnerRe Europe is a reinsurance company incorporated under the laws of Ireland and is duly authorized as a reinsurance undertaking to carry on non-life and life reinsurance business in accordance with the European Communities (Reinsurance) Regulations 2006. PartnerRe Ireland is an insurance company incorporated under the laws of Ireland and is duly authorized as an insurance undertaking to carry on non-life insurance business in accordance with the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations 1994.
Significant aspects of the Irish re/insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland include the following:
Solvency Requirements. As a composite reinsurer, PartnerRe Europe is required to maintain a minimum capital (Solvency I) requirement throughout the year. This solvency margin is determined on a premium or claims basis that covers the total sum of required solvency margins in respect of both non-life and life business activities. In addition, the Central Bank requires PartnerRe Europe to specify their Strategic Solvency Target, in excess of the minimum capital requirement. As a non-life insurer PartnerRe Ireland is required to maintain assets free of liabilities to cover the higher of 200% of the EU Solvency margin or 100% of the minimum guaranteed funds (€3.7 million).The EU Solvency margin is determined on a premium or claims basis that covers the total sum of required solvency margins in respect of non-life business activities;
Reporting Requirements. PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland must file and submit annual audited financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related reports to the Irish Companies Registration Office (CRO) together with an annual return of certain core corporate information. Changes to core corporate information during the year must also be notified to the CRO. These requirements are in addition to the regulatory returns required to be filed annually with the Central Bank and additionally, in the case of PartnerRe Ireland, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in the U.S.; and
Dividends and Distributions. Pursuant to Irish company law, PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland are restricted to declaring dividends only out of “profits available for distribution”. Profits available for distribution are, broadly, a company’s accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. Such profits may not include profits previously utilized.
In addition to the above, PartnerRe Europe has also established operating branches in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Labuan and Hong Kong and a representative office in Brazil, which are subject to Irish reinsurance supervision regulations. In addition, the Canadian branch is subject to regulation in Canada by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Singapore branch is subject to regulation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Labuan branch is subject to regulation by the Labuan Financial Services Authority and the Hong Kong branch to regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of Hong Kong. For a further discussion of the regulations pertaining to the Canadian branch see below. PartnerRe Ireland, pursuant to the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (part of the Dodd-Frank Act), is a nonadmitted alien insurer in the U.S. and is eligible to write business as an excess and surplus lines insurer in all U.S. states. PartnerRe Ireland has also established an operating branch in the United Kingdom which is subject to Irish reinsurance supervision regulations.
United States
PartnerRe U.S. Corporation is a Delaware domiciled holding company for its wholly owned (re)insurance subsidiaries, PartnerRe U.S., PartnerRe Insurance Company of New York (PRNY) and PartnerRe America Insurance Company (PRAIC) (PartnerRe U.S., PRNY and PRAIC together being the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies). The PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes and regulations of their domiciliary states, New York in the case of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and Delaware in the case of PRAIC, and all states where they are licensed, accredited or approved to underwrite insurance and reinsurance.
PartnerRe U.S. Corporation is also the owner of the Presidio Reinsurance Group, Inc. and its 100% owned subsidiaries Presidio Excess Insurance Services, Inc. (PXS), PartnerRe Management Ltd. (PRM) and Presidio Reinsurance Corporation Inc. (PRC). PXS is a managing general underwriter licensed in a number of states. PRM is domiciled in the U.K. and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. PRC is a Montana domiciled captive reinsurer.
Currently, the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies are licensed, accredited or approved reinsurers and/or insurers in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and are subject to the requirements described below:
Risk-Based Capital Requirements. The Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Insurers Model Act (the Model RBC Act), as it applies to property and casualty insurers and reinsurers, was initially adopted by the NAIC in December 1993. The Model RBC Act or similar legislation has been adopted by the majority of states in the U.S. The main purpose of the Model RBC Act is to provide a tool for insurance regulators to evaluate the capital of insurers with respect to the risks assumed by them and to determine whether there is a need for possible corrective action. U.S. insurers and reinsurers are required to report the results of their RBC calculations as part of the statutory annual statements that such insurers and reinsurers file with state insurance regulatory authorities. The Model RBC Act provides for four different levels of regulatory actions, each of which may be triggered if an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital (as defined in the Model RBC Act) is less than a corresponding level of risk-based capital. Decreases in an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital as a percentage of its Annualized Control Level (as defined in the Model RBC Act) triggers increasing regulatory actions. Such regulatory actions include but are not limited to issuance of orders for corrective action by the insurer, rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer.
Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) Ratios. A committee of state insurance regulators developed the NAIC’s IRIS primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance or reinsurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. Generally, a company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges with respect to four or more of the ratios, and regulators may then act, if the company has insufficient capital, to constrain the company’s underwriting capacity. No such action has been taken with respect to the PartnerRe U.S. Companies.
Reporting Requirements. Regulations vary from state to state, but generally require insurance holding companies and insurers and reinsurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file with their state domiciliary regulatory authorities certain reports, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. State regulatory authorities monitor compliance with, and periodically conduct examinations with respect to, state mandated standards of solvency, licensing requirements, investment limitations, and restrictions on the size of risks which may be reinsured, deposits of securities for the benefit of reinsureds, methods of accounting for assets, reserves for unearned premiums and losses, and other purposes. In general, such regulations are for the protection of reinsureds and, ultimately, their policyholders,rather than security holders. In the U.S., the New York State Department of Financial Services is the domiciliary regulator of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and the Delaware Department of Insurance is the domiciliary regulator of PRAIC.
Dividends and Distributions. Under New York law, the New York State Department of Financial Services must approve any dividend declared or paid by PartnerRe U.S. or PRNY that, together with all dividends declared or distributed by each of them during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of 10% of their respective statutory surplus as shown on the latest statutory financial statements on file with the New York Department of Financial Services, or 100% of their respective adjusted net investment income during that period. Under Delaware law the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance must approve any dividend declared or paid by PRAIC that, together with all dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (i) ten percent of PRAIC’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the net income, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the preceding December 31. Both Delaware and New York do not permit a dividend to be declared or distributed, except out of earned surplus.
In addition to the above, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) currently impacts the PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the U.S. and establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Treasury Department. Although the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance or reinsurance, it is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry, consulting with state insurance regulators, assisting in administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) and other duties. The FIO is also responsible for issuing certain reports to Congress, the President and/or others, such as the FIO’s December 2013 report which recommended limited federal regulatory involvement in areas such as the development of a uniform agreement on reinsurance collateral requirements, its September 2014 annual report on the insurance industry and its December 2014 report on the role of the global reinsurance market in supporting insurance in the U.S. Furthermore, the director of the Federal Insurance Office is a non-voting member of the multi-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and the FSOC may, among other things, subject an insurance company or an insurance holding company to heightened prudential standards in accordance with Title I of the Dodd Frank Act following an extended determination process (which can require that such insurance company be subject also to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). The Dodd-Frank Act also made small changes to the regulation of credit for reinsurance and surplus lines insurance in the U.S. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
Canada
Canadian branches of PartnerRe Bermuda, PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe U.S. hold licenses to write reinsurance business in Canada. Each Canadian branch is authorized to insure, in Canada, risks falling within the classes of insurance as specified in their respective licenses and is limited to the business of reinsurance. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed to write life business in Ontario. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe Europe is licensed to write life business in Ontario and Quebec. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe U.S. is licensed to write property and casualty business in Ontario and Quebec. Each Canadian branch is subject to local regulation for its Canadian branch business, specified principally pursuant to Part XIII of the Insurance Companies Act (the Canadian Insurance Act) applicable to foreign property and casualty companies and to foreign life companies as well as relevant provincial insurance acts. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada (OSFI) supervises the application of the Canadian Insurance Act.
PartnerRe Bermuda, PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe U.S. maintain sufficient assets, vested in trust at a Canadian financial institution approved by OSFI, to allow their branches to meet minimum statutory solvency requirements as required by the Act and the regulations made under it. Certain statutory information is filed with federal and provincial insurance regulators in respect of both property and casualty and life business written by branches. This information includes, among other things, a yearly business plan and an annual Dynamic Capital Adequacy Test (DCAT) report from the Appointed Actuary of the branch that tests the adequacy of the assets that are vested under various adverse scenarios.
Singapore
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates insurance and reinsurance companies authorized in Singapore, including PartnerRe Asia and, to a more limited extent, PartnerRe Europe’s Singapore Branch.
PartnerRe Asia is a reinsurance company incorporated under the laws of Singapore. With effect from December 26, 2014, the MAS reactivated PartnerRe Asia’s license to conduct general insurance business as a reinsurer and granted it a license to carry on life insurance business as a reinsurer. Prior to this date PartnerRe Asia was in run-off (trading as PARIS RE Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.). As of April 1, 2015, PartnerRe Asia will be the principal reinsurance carrier for PartnerRe’s business underwritten in the Asia Pacific region. PartnerRe Asia has an established operating branch in Labuan which is subject to regulation by the Labuan Financial Services Authority. Significant aspects of the Singapore reinsurance regulatory framework and requirements include the following:
Solvency Requirements: As a licensed reinsurer, PartnerRe Asia is required to maintain minimum capital of SGD25 million. In addition, PartnerRe Asia is required to establish and maintain separate insurance funds for each class of business that it carries on for both Singapore and offshore policies. The solvency requirement in respect of each insurance fund shall at all times be not less than the total risk requirement of the fund (determined by reference to three components being insurance risks, asset portfolio risks and asset concentration risks). The MAS is entitled to require that a licensed reinsurer holds assets of a certain type and prescribed value in Singapore.
Reporting Requirements: PartnerRe Asia must file and submit annual audited financial statements in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS) and related report to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) together with an annual return of certain core corporate information. Changes to core corporate information during the year must also be notified to ACRA. These requirements are in addition to the regulatory returns required to be filed annually with the MAS.
Dividends and Distribution: Dividends are generally declared from unappropriated profits. The declaration of a dividend by PartnerRe Asia may be subject to relevant conditions and requirements being met as specified under the Insurance Act (Singapore) and its associated regulations. Any proposed reduction of capital or redemption of preference shares requires the prior approval of the MAS. In addition to the above, the laws and initiatives issued by the MAS regarding Corporate Governance, Outsourcings and Technology Risk Management currently impact or may impact Partner Re Asia in the future.
Other Regulatory Considerations
Moreover, there are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact PartnerRe in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on PartnerRe could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In particular, Solvency II, adopted in the European Union but yet to be finalized, aims to establish a revised set of risk-based capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current Solvency I requirements. Once implementing measures are finalized, with implementation scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2016, Solvency II is expected to set out new, strengthened requirements applicable to the entire European Union relating to capital adequacy and risk management for insurers. Other similar measures, such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ (IAIS) announced plans to include a risk-based global insurance capital standard within the common supervision framework it is currently developing, also have the potential for significant impact on PartnerRe. Furthermore, the IAIS has developed policy measures for institutions it designates as globally systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), including enhanced supervision standards, measures to facilitate resolution, and capital requirements to increase loss absorption capacity.","The business of reinsurance is regulated in all countries in which we operate, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance businesses while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. As a holding company, PartnerRe Ltd. is not directly subject to (re)insurance regulations, but its various material operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation as follows:
Bermuda
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the Insurance Act), regulates the insurance business of PartnerRe Bermuda. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed as a Class 4 and Class E insurer in Bermuda and is therefore authorized to carry on general and long-term insurance business, respectively. Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Class 4 and Class E insurers such as PartnerRe Bermuda include the following:
Minimum Capital Requirements. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business;
Solvency Assessment. PartnerRe Bermuda must perform an assessment of its own risk and solvency requirements, referred to as a Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self Assessment (CISSA). The CISSA allows the BMA to obtain an insurer’s view of the capital resources required to achieve its business objectives and to assess a company’s governance, risk management and controls surrounding this process. PartnerRe Bermuda must prepare audited annual statutory financial statements and file them with the BMA, together with audited annual financial statements which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); and
Dividends and Distributions. PartnerRe Bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit that it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements as described above. PartnerRe is not an insurer and, as such, is not regulated in Bermuda. Significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on Insurance Groups include the solvency assessment. In addition, the PartnerRe group must file with the BMA a Catastrophe Risk Return which assesses an insurer’s reliance on vendor models in assessing catastrophe exposure. PartnerRe currently uses the BMA standard model in calculating its group ECR requirements. The Canadian branch is subject to regulation in Canada by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. PartnerRe Europe is a reinsurance company incorporated under the laws of Ireland and is duly authorized as a reinsurance undertaking to carry on non-life and life reinsurance business in accordance with the European Communities (Reinsurance) Regulations 2006. Significant aspects of the Irish re/insurance regulatory framework and requirements imposed on PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland include the following:
Solvency Requirements. In addition, the Central Bank requires PartnerRe Europe to specify their Strategic Solvency Target, in excess of the minimum capital requirement. As a non-life insurer PartnerRe Ireland is required to maintain assets free of liabilities to cover the higher of 200% of the EU Solvency margin or 100% of the minimum guaranteed funds (€3.7 million).The EU Solvency margin is determined on a premium or claims basis that covers the total sum of required solvency margins in respect of non-life business activities;
Reporting Requirements. PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland must file and submit annual audited financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related reports to the Irish Companies Registration Office (CRO) together with an annual return of certain core corporate information. Pursuant to Irish company law, PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland are restricted to declaring dividends only out of “profits available for distribution”. Such profits may not include profits previously utilized. In addition to the above, PartnerRe Europe has also established operating branches in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Labuan and Hong Kong and a representative office in Brazil, which are subject to Irish reinsurance supervision regulations. For a further discussion of the regulations pertaining to the Canadian branch see below. PartnerRe Ireland, pursuant to the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (part of the Dodd-Frank Act), is a nonadmitted alien insurer in the U.S. and is eligible to write business as an excess and surplus lines insurer in all U.S. states. The PartnerRe U.S. Insurance Companies are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes and regulations of their domiciliary states, New York in the case of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and Delaware in the case of PRAIC, and all states where they are licensed, accredited or approved to underwrite insurance and reinsurance. PartnerRe U.S. PXS is a managing general underwriter licensed in a number of states. The Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Insurers Model Act (the Model RBC Act), as it applies to property and casualty insurers and reinsurers, was initially adopted by the NAIC in December 1993. The Model RBC Act provides for four different levels of regulatory actions, each of which may be triggered if an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital (as defined in the Model RBC Act) is less than a corresponding level of risk-based capital. Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) Ratios. Regulations vary from state to state, but generally require insurance holding companies and insurers and reinsurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file with their state domiciliary regulatory authorities certain reports, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. In general, such regulations are for the protection of reinsureds and, ultimately, their policyholders,rather than security holders. In the U.S., the New York State Department of Financial Services is the domiciliary regulator of PartnerRe U.S. and PRNY, and the Delaware Department of Insurance is the domiciliary regulator of PRAIC. Dividends and Distributions. Under New York law, the New York State Department of Financial Services must approve any dividend declared or paid by PartnerRe U.S. or PRNY that, together with all dividends declared or distributed by each of them during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of 10% of their respective statutory surplus as shown on the latest statutory financial statements on file with the New York Department of Financial Services, or 100% of their respective adjusted net investment income during that period. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the U.S. and establishes a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Treasury Department. Although the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance or reinsurance, it is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry, consulting with state insurance regulators, assisting in administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) and other duties. Each Canadian branch is authorized to insure, in Canada, risks falling within the classes of insurance as specified in their respective licenses and is limited to the business of reinsurance. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe Bermuda is licensed to write life business in Ontario. The Canadian branch of PartnerRe U.S. is licensed to write property and casualty business in Ontario and Quebec. This information includes, among other things, a yearly business plan and an annual Dynamic Capital Adequacy Test (DCAT) report from the Appointed Actuary of the branch that tests the adequacy of the assets that are vested under various adverse scenarios. With effect from December 26, 2014, the MAS reactivated PartnerRe Asia’s license to conduct general insurance business as a reinsurer and granted it a license to carry on life insurance business as a reinsurer. Ltd.). PartnerRe Asia has an established operating branch in Labuan which is subject to regulation by the Labuan Financial Services Authority. Any proposed reduction of capital or redemption of preference shares requires the prior approval of the MAS. In addition to the above, the laws and initiatives issued by the MAS regarding Corporate Governance, Outsourcings and Technology Risk Management currently impact or may impact Partner Re Asia in the future. Other similar measures, such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors’ (IAIS) announced plans to include a risk-based global insurance capital standard within the common supervision framework it is currently developing, also have the potential for significant impact on PartnerRe. Furthermore, the IAIS has developed policy measures for institutions it designates as globally systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), including enhanced supervision standards, measures to facilitate resolution, and capital requirements to increase loss absorption capacity."
Item 1.,Taxation of the Company and its Subsidiaries,"The following summary of the taxation of PartnerRe Ltd., PartnerRe Bermuda, PartnerRe Europe, PartnerRe Asia and the PartnerRe U.S. Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively PartnerRe U.S. Companies) is based upon current law. Legislative, judicial or administrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. Certain subsidiaries, branch offices and representative offices of the Company are subject to taxation related to operations in Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Labuan, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.S. The discussion below covers the significant locations for which the Company or its subsidiaries are subject to taxation.
Bermuda
PartnerRe Ltd. and PartnerRe Bermuda have each received from the Minister of Finance an assurance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966 of Bermuda, to the effect that in the event that there is any legislation enacted in Bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to PartnerRe Ltd. or PartnerRe Bermuda or to any of their operations or the shares, debentures or other obligations of PartnerRe Ltd. or PartnerRe Bermuda until March 2035. These assurances are subject to the proviso that they are not construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (PartnerRe Ltd. and PartnerRe Bermuda are not currently so designated) or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act, 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to the property leased to PartnerRe Bermuda.
Canada
The Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Bermuda, the Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Europe and the Canadian non-life branch of PartnerRe U.S. are subject to Canadian taxation on their profits.
The profits of the Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Bermuda are taxed at the federal level as well as the Ontario provincial level at a total rate that was 26.50% in 2013. The profits of the Canadian life branch of PartnerRe Europe are taxed at the federal level as well as the Ontario and Quebec provincial level at a total rate that was 26.50% in 2014. The Canadian non-life branch of PartnerRe U.S. is subject to taxation on its profits at the federal level as well as the Ontario and Quebec provincial level at a total rate that was an average of 26.58% in 2014. See also the discussion of taxation in the United States and Ireland below.
France
The French branch of PartnerRe Europe is conducting business in and is subject to taxation in France. The French Parliament approved the 2014 Finance Bill, which increased the statutory rate of tax on corporate profits in France from 36.1% to 38.0%, effective for 2013 and 2014. The 2015 Finance Bill subsequently extended this measure to 2015. See also the discussion of taxation in Ireland below.
Ireland
The Company’s Irish subsidiaries, PartnerRe Holdings Europe Ltd., PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe Ireland Insurance Ltd, conduct business in and are subject to taxation in Ireland. Profits of an Irish trade or business are subject to Irish corporation tax at the rate of 12.5%, whereas profits arising from other than a trade or business are taxable at the rate of 25%. The Swiss, U.S., French, Singaporean and Canadian branches of PartnerRe Europe are subject to taxation in Ireland at the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5%. However, under Irish domestic tax law, the amount of tax paid in Switzerland, U.S., France, Singapore and Canada can be credited or deducted against the Irish corporation tax. As a result, the Company does not expect to incur significant taxation in Ireland with respect to the Swiss, U.S., French, Singaporean and Canadian branches.
Singapore
The Company’s Singaporean subsidiary, PartnerRe Asia, and the Singaporean branch of PartnerRe Europe are subject to corporate taxation in Singapore at the rate of 17% on profits arising from onshore business and 10% on profits arising from offshore business. However, tax exemption may apply to qualifying profits derived from certain lines of business.
Switzerland
The Swiss branch of PartnerRe Europe is subject to Swiss taxation, mainly on profits and capital. To the extent that net profits are generated, profits are taxed at a rate of approximately 21%. The branch pays capital taxes at a rate of approximately 0.17% on its imputed branch capital calculated according to a procured taxation ruling. See also the discussion of taxation in Ireland above.
United States
PartnerRe U.S. Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively the PartnerRe U.S. Companies) transact business in Canada and in the U.S. and are subject to taxation in the U.S.
In addition, PartnerRe Europe writes certain U.S. Facultative and Latin American business, through its reinsurance intermediaries, PartnerRe Miami Inc. (PartnerRe Miami) in Miami, Florida and PartnerRe Connecticut Inc. (PartnerRe Connecticut) in Greenwich, Connecticut. As a result, PartnerRe Europe is deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business and thus is subject to taxation in the U.S. Finally, PartnerRe Capital Investments Corporation is also a U.S. corporation subject to taxation in the U.S. The current statutory rate of tax on corporate profits in the U.S. is 35%. See the discussion of U.S. branch taxation below and the discussion of taxation in Ireland above.
On this basis, the Company does not expect that it and its subsidiaries, other than the PartnerRe U.S. Companies and PartnerRe Europe for its U.S. branches (PartnerRe Miami and PartnerRe Connecticut), will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes (other than withholding taxes as described below). However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute a trade or business in the U.S., there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not contend successfully that the Company or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. The maximum federal tax rate is currently 35% for a corporation’s income that is effectively connected with a trade or business in the U.S. In addition, U.S. branches of foreign corporations may be subject to the branch profits tax, which imposes a tax on U.S. branch after-tax earnings that are deemed repatriated out of the U.S., for a potential maximum effective federal tax rate of approximately 54% on the net income connected with a U.S. trade or business.
Foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. are subject to U.S. income tax, effected through withholding by the payer, on certain fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits and income derived from sources within the U.S. as enumerated in Section 881(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, such as dividends and interest on certain investments.
The U.S. also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the U.S. The rate of tax applicable to reinsurance premiums paid to PartnerRe Bermuda is 1% of gross premiums.","The following summary of the taxation of PartnerRe Ltd., PartnerRe Bermuda, PartnerRe Europe, PartnerRe Asia and the PartnerRe U.S. The discussion below covers the significant locations for which the Company or its subsidiaries are subject to taxation.

Item 7,Executive Overview,"The Company is a leading global reinsurer and insurer, with a broadly diversified and balanced portfolio of traditional reinsurance and insurance risks and capital markets risks.
Successful risk management is the foundation of the Company’s value proposition, with diversification of risks at the core of its risk management strategy. The Company’s ability to succeed in the risk assumption and management business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk, to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate, and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and limits for the risks assumed. All risks, whether they are reinsurance related risks or capital market risks, are managed by the Company within an integrated framework of policies and processes to ensure the intelligent and consistent evaluation and valuation of risk, and to ultimately provide an appropriate return to shareholders. For further discussion of the Company’s Risk Management framework see Risk Management in Item 1 of Part I of this report.
The Company’s long-term objective is to manage a portfolio of diversified risks that will create total shareholder value. The Company measures its success in achieving its long-term objective by targeting a return, which is variable and can be adjusted by Management, in excess of a referenced risk-free rate over the reinsurance cycle. The return is calculated using compound annual growth in diluted tangible book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding plus dividends per common share (growth in Diluted Tangible Book Value per Share plus dividends) as its prime measure of long-term financial performance and believes this measure aligns the Company’s stated long-term objective with the measure most investors use to evaluate total shareholder value creation. See below in Key Financial Measures for further discussion.","The Company is a leading global reinsurer and insurer, with a broadly diversified and balanced portfolio of traditional reinsurance and insurance risks and capital markets risks.

Item 7,"Industry Environment, Strategic Initiatives and Capital Management","As described in more detail below, the Company's Non-life operations are facing a challenging and limited growth environment, which is driven by price decreases and significant pressure on terms and conditions in most markets and lines of business. These drivers reflect increased competition and excess capacity in the industry, relatively low loss experience and a prolonged period of low interest rates. While Management believes that the Company’s strong global franchise and geographical footprint position the Company well for the future, Management has also focused on various initiatives to further diversify the Company's business.
On January 25, 2015, the Company announced that it has signed the Amalgamation Agreement with AXIS. This transaction is expected to provide the Company with an opportunity to enter the primary insurance market, benefit from increased scale and enhanced market presence and to achieve substantial benefits related to capital efficiencies, expense savings and business synergies. The AXIS transaction is further described in Business in Item 1 of Part I of this report.
Among other initiatives, in 2013, Management announced the restructuring of its business support operations into a single integrated worldwide support platform and changes to the structure of certain of its Non-life operations, both of which provided greater operational efficiency. In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of PartnerRe Health, a U.S. specialty accident and health reinsurance and insurance writer, to diversify into new lines of business and to access and benefit from opportunities relates to the reform of the medical insurance in the U.S.
As a result of the challenging business environment described above, during 2014 the Company returned approximately $551 million to its common shareholders through share repurchases and $134 million through common share dividends. As the Company looks to 2015 and beyond, despite the challenging environment, Management remains confident that with the recently announced merger, its strong global franchise, geographical footprint and technical underwriting skills the Company's operations will continue to provide strong results and remains focused on maintaining its strong relationships with clients.
The following discussion provides an overview of the Company’s business and trends and commentary regarding the outlook for 2015 in each business.","As described in more detail below, the Company's Non-life operations are facing a challenging and limited growth environment, which is driven by price decreases and significant pressure on terms and conditions in most markets and lines of business.

The following discussion provides an overview of the Company’s business and trends and commentary regarding the outlook for 2015 in each business."
Item 7,"Non-life reinsurance and insurance business, trends and 2015 outlook","The Company generates its Non-life reinsurance and insurance revenue from premiums. Premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions. Pricing cycles are driven by supply of capital in the industry and demand for reinsurance and insurance and other risk transfer products. The reinsurance and insurance business is also influenced by several other factors, including variations in interest rates and financial markets, changes in legal, regulatory and judicial environments, loss trends, inflation and general economic conditions.
In its reinsurance portfolio, the Company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide. In addition, the Company provides certain specialty insurance lines of business. The Company differentiates itself through its risk management strategy, its financial strength and its strong global franchise. In assuming its clients’ risks, the Company removes the volatility associated with those risks from the client, and then manages those risks and the risk-related volatility. Through its broad product and geographic diversification, its execution capabilities and its local presence in most major markets, the Company is able to stabilize returns, respond quickly to market needs, and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world.
A key challenge facing the Company is to successfully manage risk through all phases of the reinsurance cycle. The Company believes that its long-term strategy of closely monitoring the progression of each line of business, being selective in the business that it writes, and maintaining the diversification and balance of its portfolio, will optimize returns over the reinsurance cycle. Individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time. Management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product, geography, line and type of business, length of tail, and distribution channel. Further, Management believes that this diversification, in addition to the financial strength of the Company and its strong global franchise, will help to mitigate cyclical declines in underwriting profitability and achieve a more stable return over the reinsurance cycle.
The Non-life reinsurance market has historically been highly cyclical in nature as evidenced by hard and soft markets. Since late 2003, the Company began to see the emergence of a soft market across most lines of business with general decreases in pricing and profitability. With the exception of lines and markets impacted by specific catastrophic or large loss events, this trend continued throughout the next decade.
During the January 1, 2015 renewals, the Company experienced a decrease of approximately 1% in renewable Non-life treaty business, on a constant foreign exchange basis. The decrease in renewable premium volume was driven by all Non-life sub-segments, except for the Global (Non-U.S.) P&C sub-segment, and reflects a very challenging renewal season, with clients retaining more business, further reductions in pricing, significant pressure on terms and conditions as a result of excess capital and limited new opportunities. The excess capacity in the industry and cedants retaining more business and decreasing the available premium in the global industry, combined with the growth in insurance-linked securities and other alternative capital flows into the industry, continue to provide a challenge to writing business that meets our profitability requirements. Despite these persistent challenging market conditions, the Company believes that its strong global franchise and geographic footprint, long track record, broad yet highly technical capabilities over many lines of business, position the Company well.
The Company writes a large majority of its business on a treaty basis and renewed approximately 70% of its total annual Non-life treaty business on January 1, 2015. The remainder of the Non-life treaty business renews at other times during the year. In addition to treaty business, the Company writes approximately $400 million of direct and facultative business which renews throughout the year.","Pricing cycles are driven by supply of capital in the industry and demand for reinsurance and insurance and other risk transfer products.

The remainder of the Non-life treaty business renews at other times during the year."
Item 7,"Life and Health reinsurance business, trends and 2015 outlook","The Company’s Life and Health segment derives revenues primarily from renewal premiums from existing reinsurance treaties and new premiums from existing or new reinsurance treaties. Within the Life and Health segment, the Company writes mortality (including disability), longevity and, following the acquisition of PartnerRe Health, U.S. accident and health products. Management believes the existing life business and PartnerRe Health business provide the Company with diversification benefits and balance to its portfolio as they are generally not correlated to the Company’s Non-life business.
The long-term profitability of the life business (including the mortality and longevity lines of business) mainly depends on the volume and amount of death claims incurred and the ability to adequately price the risk the Company assumes. The life reinsurance policies are often in force for the remaining lifetime of the underlying individuals insured, with premiums earned typically over a period of 10 to 30 years. The volume of the business may be reduced each year by terminations of the underlying treaties related to lapses, voluntary surrenders, death of insureds and recaptures by ceding companies. While death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years, claims become less predictable over shorter periods and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year.
The long-term profitability of the accident and health business mainly depends on the volume and amount of medical claims and expenses. While the volume of medical claims can be predicted to a certain extent, the amount of claims and expenses depends on various factors, primarily health care inflation rates, driven by a shift towards the older population, reliance on expensive medical equipment and technology, and changes in demand for health care services over time.
The acquisition of the PartnerRe Health business resulted in substantial overall premium growth in the Company’s Life and Health segment in 2013 and 2014, primarily as a result of its transition from a Managing General Agent (MGA) to an insurance carrier in 2013 (see Business in Item 1 of Part I of this report for more details) and the opportunities arising from the implementation of the Healthcare Act in the U.S. At the January 1, 2015 renewals, the expected premium volume, at constant foreign exchange rates, increased compared to the prior year renewal despite increased competition. Growth originated primarily from employer markets and reinsurance products that support the Healthcare Act. Management expects continued although more modest growth in 2015.
In terms of the Company's Life portfolio, the active January 1 renewals only impact the short-term in-force premium in the mortality line, which is a relatively limited portion of the overall Life portfolio. For those treaties that actively renewed, pricing conditions and terms were modestly softer from the January 1, 2014 renewals. Management expects moderate continued growth in the Company’s Life portfolio in 2015 from new business initiatives, assuming constant foreign exchange rates.","The long-term profitability of the life business (including the mortality and longevity lines of business) mainly depends on the volume and amount of death claims incurred and the ability to adequately price the risk the Company assumes.

Management expects moderate continued growth in the Company’s Life portfolio in 2015 from new business initiatives, assuming constant foreign exchange rates."
Item 7,"Investment business, trends and 2015 outlook","The Company generates revenue from its high quality investment portfolio, as well as the investments underlying the funds held - directly managed account, through net investment income, including coupon interest on fixed maturities and dividends on equities, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments.
For the Company’s investment risks, which include both public and private market investments, diversification of risk is critical to achieving the risk and return objectives of the Company. The Company’s investment policy distinguishes between liquid, high quality assets that support the Company’s liabilities, and the more diversified, higher risk asset classes that make up the Company’s capital funds. While there will be years where investment markets risks achieve less than the risk-free rate of return, or potentially even negative results, the Company believes the rewards for assuming these risks in a disciplined and measured way will produce a positive excess return to the Company over time. Additionally, since investment risks are not fully correlated with the Company’s reinsurance risks, this increases the overall diversification of the Company’s total risk portfolio.
The Company follows prudent investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the Company’s overall objectives of earnings stability and long-term book value growth. The Company allocates its invested assets into two categories: liability funds and capital funds (see the discussion of liability funds and capital funds in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources). A key challenge for the Company is achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns (that include price appreciation or depreciation) in changing market conditions. The Company regularly reviews the allocation of investments to asset classes within its investment portfolio and its funds held - directly managed account and allocates investments to those asset classes the Company anticipates will outperform in the near future, subject to limits and guidelines. Similarly, the Company reduces its exposure to risk asset classes where returns are deemed unattractive. The Company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates, or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes, depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions.
The Company’s investment operations have experienced volatile market conditions since the middle of 2007. The market conditions remained volatile in 2014, primarily due to decreases in U.S. and European risk-free interest rates and improvements in worldwide equity markets. Assuming constant foreign exchange rates, Management expects net investment income to continue to decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower reinvestment rates with low yields expected to continue throughout 2015. Management expects this decrease to be partially offset by expected positive cash flow from operations (including net investment income).","For the Company’s investment risks, which include both public and private market investments, diversification of risk is critical to achieving the risk and return objectives of the Company. The Company allocates its invested assets into two categories: liability funds and capital funds (see the discussion of liability funds and capital funds in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources). A key challenge for the Company is achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns (that include price appreciation or depreciation) in changing market conditions. The Company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates, or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes, depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions.

Item 7,Overview of the Results of Operations,"The Company measures its performance in several ways. Among the performance measures accepted under U.S. GAAP is diluted net income or loss per share, a measure that focuses on the return provided to the Company’s common shareholders. Diluted net income or loss per share is obtained by dividing net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders is defined as net income or loss less preferred dividends and loss on redemption of preferred shares. The Company's net income, net income attributable to PartnerRe Ltd., net income attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders and diluted net income per share are discussed below in Review of Net Income.",The Company measures its performance in several ways. Diluted net income or loss per share is obtained by dividing net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding.
Item 7,Comment on Non-GAAP Measures,"Throughout this filing, the Company’s results of operations have been presented in the way that Management believes will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use financial information in evaluating the performance of the Company. This presentation includes the use of Diluted Tangible Book Value per Share, Diluted Tangible Book Value per Share plus dividends, operating earnings or loss, diluted operating earnings or loss per share and Operating ROE that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise U.S. GAAP. These measures are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use the Company’s financial information and will help provide a consistent basis for comparison between years and for comparison with the Company’s peer group, although non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, diluted book value per share, net income or loss and return on beginning common shareholders’ equity calculated with net income or loss attributable to common shareholders, is presented above.","This presentation includes the use of Diluted Tangible Book Value per Share, Diluted Tangible Book Value per Share plus dividends, operating earnings or loss, diluted operating earnings or loss per share and Operating ROE that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise U.S. GAAP.

Item 7,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,"The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that Management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgment. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by Management, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, including Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, for a full understanding of the Company’s accounting policies. The sensitivity estimates that follow are based on outcomes that the Company considers reasonably likely to occur.","The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). These critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, including Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, for a full understanding of the Company’s accounting policies."
Item 7,Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses,"Because a significant amount of time can elapse between the assumption of risk, occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance company (the primary company or the cedant), the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company (the reinsurer) and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer, the Company’s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) is based largely upon estimates. The Company categorizes loss reserves into three types of reserves: reported outstanding loss reserves (case reserves), additional case reserves (ACRs) and IBNR. The Company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants. Case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the Company’s cedants and recorded by the Company. ACRs are established for particular circumstances where, on the basis of individual loss reports, the Company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant. IBNR reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company, as well as future loss development on losses already reported, in excess of the case reserves and ACRs. Unlike case reserves and ACRs, IBNR reserves are often calculated at an aggregated level and cannot usually be directly identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty. The Company also estimates the future unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) associated with the loss reserves and these form part of the Company’s loss adjustment expense reserves. The Company’s Non-life loss reserves for each category, line and sub-segment are reported in the tables included later in this section.
The amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail. Lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short-tail lines; and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long-tail lines. In general, for reinsurance, the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer(s). The delay varies by reinsurance market (country of cedant), type of treaty, whether losses are first paid by the cedant and the size of the loss. The delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer. The Company considers agriculture, catastrophe, energy, property, motor business written in the U.S., proportional motor business written outside of the U.S., specialty property and structured property to be short-tail lines; aviation/space, credit/surety, engineering, marine and multiline to be medium-tail lines; and casualty, non-proportional motor business written outside of the U.S. and specialty casualty to be long-tail lines of business. For all lines, the Company’s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses. Total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and ACRs from total loss reserves.
The Company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells. The Company assigns treaties to reserving cells and allocates losses from the treaty to the reserving cell. The reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics (e.g., reporting tail) but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible. The selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the Company evolves. For each reserving cell, the Company tabulates losses in reserving triangles that show the total reported or paid claims at each financial year end by underwriting year cohort. An underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred (accident year), or the calendar year for which financial results are reported. For each reserving cell, the Company’s estimates of loss reserves are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies. In selecting its best estimate, the Company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the reserving cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made. The methodologies that the Company employs include, but may not be limited to, paid and reported Chain Ladder methods, Expected Loss Ratio method, paid and reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) methods, and paid and reported Benktander methods. In addition, the Company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims. For example, reserves established for the catastrophe line are primarily a function of the presence or absence of catastrophic events during the year, and the complexity and uncertainty associated with estimating unpaid losses from these large disclosed events. Internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer. In addition, reserves are also established in consideration of mid-sized and attritional loss events that occur during a year. In the case of asbestos and environmental claims, the Company has established reserves for future losses and allocated loss expenses based on the results of periodic actuarial studies, which consider the underlying exposures of the Company’s cedants.
The reserve methodologies employed by the Company are dependent on data that the Company collects. This data consists primarily of loss amounts and loss payments reported by the Company’s cedants, and premiums written and earned reported by cedants or estimated by the Company. The actuarial methods used by the Company to project loss reserves that it will pay in the future do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported, claim counts settled or claim counts open as, due to the nature of the Company’s business, this information is not routinely provided by cedants for every treaty.
A brief description of the reserving methods commonly employed by the Company and a discussion of their particular advantages and disadvantages follows:
Chain Ladder (CL) Development Methods (Reported or Paid)
These methods use the underlying assumption that losses reported (paid) for each underwriting year at a particular development stage follow a stable pattern. For example, the CL development method assumes that on average, every underwriting year will display the same percentage of ultimate liabilities reported by the Company’s cedants (say x%) at 24 months after the inception of the underwriting year. The percentages reported (paid) are established for each development stage (e.g., at 12 months, 24 months, etc.) after examining historical averages from the loss development data. These are sometimes supplemented by external benchmark information. Ultimate liabilities are estimated by multiplying the actual reported (paid) losses by the reciprocal of the assumed reported (paid) percentage (e.g., 1/x%). Reserves are then calculated by subtracting paid claims from the estimated ultimate liabilities.
The main strengths of the method are that it is reactive to loss emergence (payments) and that it makes full use of historical experience on claim emergence (payments). For homogeneous low volatility lines, under stable economic conditions the method can often produce good estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves. However, the method has weaknesses when the underlying assumption of stable patterns is not true. This may be the consequence of changes in the mix of business, changes in claim inflation trends, changes in claim reporting practices or the presence of large claims, among other things. Furthermore, the method tends to produce volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities in situations where there is volatility in reported (paid) patterns. In particular, when the expected percentage reported (paid) is low, small deviations between actual and expected claims can lead to very volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves. Consequently, this method is often unsuitable for projections at early development stages of an underwriting year. Finally, the method fails to incorporate any information regarding market conditions, pricing, etc., which could improve the estimate of liabilities and reserves. It therefore tends not to perform very well in situations where there are rapidly changing market conditions.
Expected Loss Ratio (ELR) Method
This method estimates ultimate losses for an underwriting year by applying an estimated loss ratio to the earned premium for that underwriting year. Although the method is insensitive to actual reported or paid losses, it can often be useful at the early stages of development when very few losses have been reported or paid, and the principal sources of information available to the Company consist of information obtained during pricing and qualitative information supplied by the cedant. However, the lack of sensitivity to reported or paid losses means that the method is usually inappropriate at later stages of development.
Bornhuetter-Ferguson (B-F) Methods (Reported or Paid)
These methods aim to address the concerns of the Chain Ladder Development methods, which are the variability at early stages of development and the failure to incorporate external information such as pricing. However, the B-F methods are more sensitive to reported and paid losses than the Expected Loss Ratio method, and can be seen as a blend of the Expected Loss Ratio and Chain Ladder development methods. Unreported (unpaid) claims are calculated using an expected reporting (payment) pattern and an externally determined estimate of ultimate liabilities (usually determined by multiplying an a priori loss ratio with estimates of premium volume). The accuracy of the a priori loss ratio is a critical assumption in this method. Usually a priori loss ratios are initially determined on the basis of pricing information, but may also be adjusted to reflect other information that subsequently emerges about underlying loss experience. Although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment, this method can be slow to react to emerging loss development (payment). In particular, to the extent that the a priori loss ratios prove to be inaccurate (and are not revised), the B-F methods will produce loss estimates that take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss liabilities.
Benktander (B-K) Methods (Reported or Paid)
These methods can be viewed as a blend between the Chain Ladder Development and the B-F methods described above. The blend is based on predetermined weights at each development stage that depend on the reported (paid) development patterns.
Although mitigated to some extent, this method still exhibits the same advantages and disadvantages as the B-F method, but the mechanics of the calculation imply that it is more reactive to loss emergence (payment) than the B-F method.
Loss Event Specific Method
The ultimate losses estimated under this method are derived from estimates of specific events based on reported claims, client and broker discussions, review of potential exposures, market loss estimates, modeled analysis and other event specific criteria.
Method Weights
In determining the loss reserves, the Company often relies on a blend of the results from two or more methods (e.g., weighted averages). The judgment as to which of the above method(s) is most appropriate for a particular underwriting year and reserving cell could change over time as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other data issues. Furthermore, as each line is typically composed of several reserving cells, it is likely that the reserves for the line will be dependent on several reserving methods. This is because reserves for a line are the result of aggregating the reserves for each constituent reserving cell and that a different method could be selected for each reserving cell. Although it is not appropriate to refer to reserves for a line as being determined by a particular method, the table below summarizes the methods that were given principal weight in selecting the best estimates of reserves in each reserving line and can therefore be viewed as key drivers of selected reserves. The table distinguishes methods for mature and immature underwriting years, as they are often different. The definition of maturity is specific to a line and is related to the reporting tail. If at the reserve evaluation date, a significant proportion of losses for the underwriting year are expected to have been reported, then the underwriting year is deemed to be mature, otherwise it is deemed to be immature. For short-tail lines, such as property or agriculture, immature years can refer to the one or two most recent underwriting years, while for longer tail lines, such as casualty, immature years can refer to the three or four most recent underwriting years.
","The Company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants. IBNR reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company, as well as future loss development on losses already reported, in excess of the case reserves and ACRs.

Item 7,Goodwill,"Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination (PartnerRe SA, Winterthur Re, Paris Re and PartnerRe Health). The Company assesses the appropriateness of its valuation of goodwill on at least an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If, as a result of the assessment, the Company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired, goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made. Based upon the Company's assessment, there was no impairment of the Company’s goodwill asset of $456 million at December 31, 2014.
In making an assessment of the value of its goodwill, the Company uses both market based and non-market based valuations. The fair value of the reporting units is determined based on the earnings multiple, price to tangible book value multiple, present value of estimated cash flows and present value of future profits methods. Significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the Company’s goodwill asset. In addition, if the current economic environment and/or the Company’s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly, this could lead to an impairment of goodwill, the write-off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred.","If, as a result of the assessment, the Company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired, goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made. The fair value of the reporting units is determined based on the earnings multiple, price to tangible book value multiple, present value of estimated cash flows and present value of future profits methods. Significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the Company’s goodwill asset."
Item 7,Intangible Assets,"Intangible assets represent the fair value adjustments related to unpaid losses and loss expenses and the fair values of renewal rights, customer relationships and U.S. licenses arising from acquisitions. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The Company recognizes the amortization of all intangible assets in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment is recognized if the carrying values of the intangible assets are not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and are measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Based upon the Company’s assessment, there was no impairment of its intangible assets of $160 million at December 31, 2014.","Intangible assets represent the fair value adjustments related to unpaid losses and loss expenses and the fair values of renewal rights, customer relationships and U.S. licenses arising from acquisitions.

Interest on the promissory note commenced on June 1, 2010 and is payable semi-annually at an annual fixed rate of 5.500%, and cannot be deferred. In May 2008, PartnerRe Finance A LLC (PartnerRe Finance A), an indirect 100% owned subsidiary of the parent company, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes (2008 Senior Notes, or collectively with 2010 Senior Notes referred to as Senior Notes). Interest on the 2008 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually and commenced on December 1, 2008 at an annual fixed rate of 6.875%, and cannot be deferred. The 2008 Senior Notes are ranked as senior unsecured obligations of PartnerRe Finance A. The parent company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of PartnerRe Finance A under the 2008 Senior Notes. For each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred interest expense and paid interest of $17.2 million in relation to the 2008 Senior Notes issued by PartnerRe Finance A. The CENts will mature on December 1, 2066 and may be redeemed at the option of the issuer, in whole or in part, after December 1, 2016 or earlier upon occurrence of specific rating agency or tax events. PartnerRe Finance II may elect to defer one or more interest payments for up to ten years, although interest will continue to accrue and compound at the rate of interest applicable to the CENts. The CENts are ranked as junior subordinated unsecured obligations of PartnerRe Finance II. Contemporaneously, PartnerRe U.S. Holdings issued a 6.440% Fixed-to-Floating Rate promissory note, with a principal amount of $257.6 million to PartnerRe Finance II. Interest on the promissory note is payable semi-annually and commenced on June 1, 2007 through to December 1, 2016 at an annual fixed rate of 6.440% and will be payable quarterly thereafter until maturity at an annual rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.325%. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the aggregate principal amount of the CENts and promissory note outstanding was $63.4 million and $71.0 million, respectively."
Item 7,Allocated underwriting result,"2014 compared to 2013
The allocated underwriting result of $73 million in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased profitability generated from the PartnerRe Health business due to the transition from an MGA to a carrier, as described above, being offset by a lower level of net favorable prior year loss development from the mortality and longevity lines of business.
The decrease in net favorable prior year loss development of $20 million resulted from net favorable loss development of $19 million in 2014 compared to $39 million in 2013 and was almost entirely driven by a lower level of favorable development from the GMDB business. The net favorable prior year loss development of $19 million in 2014 was primarily related to the GMDB business, PartnerRe Health and certain short-term treaties in the mortality line. The net favorable loss development for prior accident years in 2013 is described below.
2013 compared to 2012
The allocated underwriting result increased by $25 million, from $48 million in 2012 to $73 million in 2013. The increase was primarily driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year loss development in 2013 compared to 2012, the inclusion of PartnerRe Health’s results and an increase in other income. These factors driving the increase in the allocated underwriting result were partially offset by higher other expenses.
The increase in net favorable prior year loss development of $25 million reflects net favorable loss development of $39 million in 2013 compared to $14 million in 2012. The net favorable prior year loss development of $39 million in 2013 was primarily related to the GMDB business and, to a lesser extent, certain short-term treaties in the mortality line of business. The favorable development was primarily due to favorable claims experience, data updates received from cedants and improvements in the capital markets related to the GMDB business. The net favorable prior year loss development in 2012 was primarily due to the GMDB business, mainly driven by improvements in the capital markets, and certain short-term treaties in the mortality line.
Other income increased by $7 million, from $4 million in 2012 to $11 million in 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of the MGA fees earned by PartnerRe Health.
Other expenses increased by $19 million, from $52 million in 2012 to $71 million in 2013 primarily due to the inclusion of PartnerRe Health’s other expenses and higher bonus accruals. The overall impact on the allocated underwriting result of including PartnerRe Health’s other expenses was partially offset by the MGA fees earned by PartnerRe Health, which are included in other income.","2014 compared to 2013

Item 7,2015 Outlook,"PartnerRe Health's business is expected to continue contributing to overall premium growth in the Life and Health segment in 2015. At the January 1, 2015 renewals, the expected premium volume, at constant foreign exchange rates, increased compared to the prior year renewal despite increased competition. Growth originated primarily from employer markets and reinsurance products that support the Healthcare Act.
In terms of the Company's Life portfolio, the majority of the premium arises from long-term in-force contracts. The active January 1 renewals only impact the short-term in-force premium in the mortality line, which is a relatively limited portion of the Life portfolio. For those treaties that actively renewed, pricing conditions and terms were under moderate pressure compared to the January 1, 2014 renewals. Management expects moderate continued growth in the Company’s Life portfolio in 2015, assuming constant foreign exchange rates.","PartnerRe Health's business is expected to continue contributing to overall premium growth in the Life and Health segment in 2015.

Management expects moderate continued growth in the Company’s Life portfolio in 2015, assuming constant foreign exchange rates."
Item 7,Credit Agreements,"In the normal course of its operations, the Company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured and secured letter of credit facilities. At December 31, 2014, the total amount of such credit facilities available to the Company was approximately $843 million, with each of the significant facilities described below. Under the terms of certain reinsurance agreements, irrevocable letters of credit were issued on an unsecured and secured basis in the amount of $122 million and $420 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014, in respect of reported loss and unearned premium reserves.
The Company maintains a $300 million combined credit facility, with the first $100 million being unsecured and any utilization above the initial $100 million being secured. This credit facility matures on November 14, 2015.
In addition, the Company maintains committed secured letter of credit facilities. These facilities are used for the issuance of letters of credit, which must be fully secured with cash and/or government bonds and/or investment grade bonds. The agreements include default covenants, which could require the Company to fully secure the outstanding letters of credit to the extent that the facility is not already fully secured, and disallow the issuance of any new letters of credit. Included in the Company’s secured credit facilities at December 31, 2014 is a $300 million secured credit facility, which matures on December 31, 2018, and a $140 million secured credit facility, which matures on December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2014, no conditions of default existed under these facilities.","In the normal course of its operations, the Company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured and secured letter of credit facilities.

This credit facility matures on November 14, 2015. At December 31, 2014, no conditions of default existed under these facilities."
Item 7a,Overview,"Management believes that the Company is principally exposed to five types of market related risk: interest rate risk, credit spread risk, foreign currency risk, counterparty credit risk and equity price risk. How these risks relate to the Company, and the process used to manage them, is discussed below.
As discussed above in this report, the Company’s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance liabilities (liability funds) and those assets that represent shareholder capital (capital funds). Liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition to provide a natural hedge against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The Company’s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in U.S. dollar denominated investments. In considering the market risk of capital funds, it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification. Although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio, market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times. Consequently, the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks.
Although the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone, it is important to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the Company’s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of assets and liabilities in a way that is generally offsetting.
As described above in this report, the Company’s investment strategy allows the use of derivative investments, subject to strict limitations. The Company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all derivative transactions and aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk exposure. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information related to derivatives.
The following addresses those areas where the Company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations.","Liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition to provide a natural hedge against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

As described above in this report, the Company’s investment strategy allows the use of derivative investments, subject to strict limitations."
Item 7a,Interest Rate Risk,"The Company’s fixed maturity portfolio and the fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio underlying the funds held - directly managed account are exposed to interest rate risk. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities. The Company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities. The Company believes that this process of matching the duration mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis. For unpaid loss reserves and policy benefits related to non-life and traditional life business, the estimated duration of the Company’s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns. For policy benefits related to annuity business, the Company estimates duration based on its commitment to annuitants. The Company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk-reward relationship.
While this matching of duration insulates the Company from the economic impact of interest rate changes, changes in interest rates do impact the Company’s shareholders’ equity. The Company’s liabilities are carried at their nominal value, and are not adjusted for changes in interest rates, with the exception of certain policy benefits for life and annuity contracts and deposit liabilities that are interest rate sensitive. However, substantially all of the Company’s invested assets (including the investments underlying the funds held - directly managed account) are carried at fair value, which reflects such changes. As a result, an increase in interest rates will result in a decrease in the fair value of the Company’s investments (including the investments underlying the funds held - directly managed account) and a corresponding decrease, net of applicable taxes, in the Company’s shareholders’ equity. A decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect.
At December 31, 2014, the Company held approximately $3,492 million of its total invested assets in mortgage/asset-backed securities. These assets are exposed to prepayment risk, the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment.","Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities.

A decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect. These assets are exposed to prepayment risk, the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment."
Item 7a,Counterparty Credit Risk,"Investments and Cash
The Company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity securities. The Company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed maturity securities it purchases. At December 31, 2014, approximately 57% of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio (including the funds held – directly managed account and funds holding fixed maturity securities) was rated AA (or equivalent rating) or better.
At December 31, 2014, approximately 76% of the Company’s fixed maturity and short-term investments (including funds holding fixed maturity securities and excluding the funds held – directly managed account) were rated A- or better and 8% were rated below investment grade or not rated. The Company believes this high quality concentration reduces its exposure to credit risk on fixed maturity investments to an acceptable level. At December 31, 2014, the Company was not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk on its investments, excluding securities issued by the U.S. government which are rated AA+. The single largest non-U.S. sovereign government issuer accounted for less than 19% of the Company’s total non-U.S. sovereign government, supranational and government related category (excluding the funds held – directly managed account) and less than 3% of total investments and cash (excluding the funds held – directly managed account) at December 31, 2014. In addition, the single largest corporate issuer and the top 10 corporate issuers accounted for less than 3% and less than 18% of the Company’s total corporate fixed maturity securities (excluding the funds held – directly managed account), respectively, at December 31, 2014. Within the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held – directly managed account, the single largest corporate issuer and the top 10 corporate issuers accounted for less than 6% and less than 38% of total corporate fixed maturity securities underlying the funds held – directly managed account at December 31, 2014, respectively.
The Company keeps cash and cash equivalents in several banks and ensures that there are no significant concentrations at any point in time, in any one bank.
Funds held – directly managed account
The funds held – directly managed account due to the Company is related to one cedant, Colisée Re (see Investments underlying the Funds Held – Directly Managed Account in Item 1 of Part I of this report). The Company is subject to the credit risk of this cedant in the event of insolvency or Colisée Re’s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason. However, the Company’s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the Company generally has the right to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the Company to the cedant for losses payable and other amounts contractually due. See also Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report for additional discussion of the Company’s exposure if Colisée Re, or its affiliates, breach or do not satisfy their obligations. In addition to exposure to Colisée Re, the Company is also subject to the credit risk of AXA or its affiliates in the event of their insolvency or their failure to honor their obligations under the acquisition agreements.
Derivatives
To a lesser extent, the Company also has credit risk exposure as a party to foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative contracts. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors its exposure by counterparty, aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties. These contracts are generally of short duration (approximately 90 days) and settle on a net basis, which means that the Company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other, as opposed to the notional amount of the contracts. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s absolute notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts was $2,124 million, while the net fair value of those contracts was an asset position of $11 million.
Underwriting Operations
The Company is also exposed to credit risk in its underwriting operations, most notably in the credit/surety line. Loss experience in these lines of business is cyclical and is affected by the general economic environment. The Company provides its clients in these lines of business with protection against credit deterioration, defaults or other types of financial non-performance of or by the underlying credits that are the subject of the protection provided and, accordingly, the Company is exposed to the credit risk of those credits. As with all of the Company’s business, these risks are subject to rigorous underwriting and pricing standards. In addition, the Company strives to mitigate the risks associated with these credit-sensitive lines of business through the use of risk management techniques such as risk diversification, careful monitoring of risk aggregations and accumulations and, at times, through the use of retrocessional reinsurance protection and the purchase of credit default swaps and total return and interest rate swaps.
The Company is subject to the credit risk of its cedants in the event of their insolvency or their failure to honor the value of the funds held balances due to the Company for any other reason. However, the Company’s credit risk in some jurisdictions is mitigated by a mandatory right of offset of amounts payable by the Company to a cedant against amounts due to the Company. In certain other jurisdictions the Company is able to mitigate this risk, depending on the nature of the funds held arrangements, to the extent that the Company has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the Company to cedants for losses payable and other amounts contractually due. Funds held balances for which the Company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant or the investment return earned by the cedant on its investment portfolio are exposed to an additional layer of credit risk. The Company is also exposed, to some extent, to the underlying financial market risk of the pool of assets, inasmuch as the underlying policies may have guaranteed minimum returns.
The Company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its business written through brokers if any of the Company’s brokers is unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to payments to the Company. In addition, in some jurisdictions, if the broker fails to make payments to the insured under the Company’s policy, the Company might remain liable to the insured for the deficiency. The Company’s exposure to such credit risk is somewhat mitigated in certain jurisdictions by contractual terms. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report for information related to two brokers that accounted for approximately 40% of the Company’s gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The Company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses. Reinsurance balances receivable from the Company’s cedants at December 31, 2014 were $2,455 million, including balances both currently due and accrued. The Company believes that credit risk related to these balances is mitigated by several factors, including but not limited to, credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances. In addition, as the majority of its reinsurance agreements permit the Company the right to offset reinsurance balances receivable from clients against losses payable to them, the Company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible and the allowance for uncollectible premiums receivable was $8 million at December 31, 2014.
The Company purchases retrocessional reinsurance and requires its reinsurers to have adequate financial strength. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis. Provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible. At December 31, 2014, the balance of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid non-life and life reserves was $244 million, which is net of the allowance provided for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables of $13 million. At December 31, 2014, 70% of the Company’s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid non-life and life reserves were either due from reinsurers with an A- or better rating from Standard & Poor’s. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Reinsurance Recoverable on Paid and Unpaid Losses above for details of the Company’s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses categorized by the reinsurer’s Standard & Poor’s rating.
Other than the items discussed above, the concentrations of the Company’s counterparty credit risk exposures have not changed materially at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.","Investments and Cash

Item 8,Significant Accounting Policies,"The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While Management believes that the amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect its best estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s principal estimates include:
Unpaid losses and loss expenses;
Policy benefits for life and annuity contracts;
Gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned;
Recoverability of deferred acquisition costs;
Recoverability of deferred tax assets;
Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; and
Valuation of certain assets and derivative financial instruments that are measured using significant unobservable inputs.The following are the Company’s significant accounting policies:

Valuation of certain assets and derivative financial instruments that are measured using significant unobservable inputs.The following are the Company’s significant accounting policies:"
Item 8,(a) Premiums,"Gross premiums written and earned are based upon reports received from ceding companies, supplemented by the Company’s own estimates of premiums written and earned for which ceding company reports have not been received. The determination of premium estimates requires a review of the Company’s experience with cedants, familiarity with each market, an understanding of the characteristics of each line of business and Management’s assessment of the impact of various other factors on the volume of business written and ceded to the Company. Premium estimates are updated as new information is received from cedants and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which the estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined. Net premiums written and earned are presented net of ceded premiums, which represent the cost of retrocessional protection purchased by the Company. Premiums are earned on a basis that is consistent with the risks covered under the terms of the reinsurance contracts, which is generally one to two years. For U.S. and European wind and certain other risks, premiums are earned commensurate with the seasonality of the underlying exposure. Reinstatement premiums are recognized as written and earned at the time a loss event occurs, where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on Management’s estimate of losses and loss expenses associated with the loss event. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired risks under contracts in force.
Premiums related to individual life and annuity business are recorded over the premium-paying period on the underlying policies. Premiums on annuity and universal life contracts for which there is no significant mortality or critical illness risk are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest-bearing financial instruments and are not reported as revenues, but rather as direct deposits to the contract. Amounts assessed against annuity and universal life policyholders are recognized as revenue in the period assessed.","Net premiums written and earned are presented net of ceded premiums, which represent the cost of retrocessional protection purchased by the Company. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on Management’s estimate of losses and loss expenses associated with the loss event. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired risks under contracts in force. Premiums on annuity and universal life contracts for which there is no significant mortality or critical illness risk are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest-bearing financial instruments and are not reported as revenues, but rather as direct deposits to the contract. Amounts assessed against annuity and universal life policyholders are recognized as revenue in the period assessed."
Item 8,(b) Losses and Loss Expenses and Life Policy Benefits,"The liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses includes amounts determined from loss reports on individual treaties (case reserves), additional case reserves when the Company’s loss estimate is higher than reported by the cedants (ACRs) and amounts for losses incurred but not yet reported to the Company (IBNR). Such reserves are estimated by Management based upon reports received from ceding companies, supplemented by the Company’s own actuarial estimates of reserves for which ceding company reports have not been received, and based on the Company’s own historical experience. To the extent that the Company’s own historical experience is inadequate for estimating reserves, such estimates may be determined based upon industry experience and Management’s judgment. The estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. Any adjustments are reflected in the periods in which they are determined, which may affect the Company’s operating results in future periods.
The liabilities for policy benefits for ordinary life and accident and health policies have been established based upon information reported by ceding companies, supplemented by the Company’s actuarial estimates of mortality, critical illness, persistency and future investment income, with appropriate provision to reflect uncertainty. Future policy benefit reserves for annuity and universal life contracts are carried at their accumulated values. Reserves for policy claims and benefits include both mortality and critical illness claims in the process of settlement, and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.
The Company purchases retrocessional contracts to reduce its exposure to risk of losses on reinsurance assumed. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses involves actuarial estimates consistent with those used to establish the associated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits.
","Such reserves are estimated by Management based upon reports received from ceding companies, supplemented by the Company’s own actuarial estimates of reserves for which ceding company reports have not been received, and based on the Company’s own historical experience.

Future policy benefit reserves for annuity and universal life contracts are carried at their accumulated values. Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses involves actuarial estimates consistent with those used to establish the associated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits."
Item 8,(c) Deferred Acquisition Costs,"Acquisition costs, comprising only incremental brokerage fees, commissions and excise taxes, which vary directly with, and are related to, the acquisition of reinsurance contracts, are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium is earned. All other acquisition related costs, including all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred.
Acquisition costs related to individual life and annuity contracts are deferred and amortized over the premium-paying periods in proportion to anticipated premium income, allowing for lapses, terminations and anticipated investment income. Acquisition costs related to universal life and single premium annuity contracts for which there is no significant mortality or critical illness risk are deferred and amortized over the lives of the contracts as a percentage of the estimated gross profits expected to be realized on the contracts.
Actual and anticipated losses and loss expenses, other costs and investment income related to underlying premiums are considered in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs related to the Company’s Non-life business. Actual and anticipated loss experience, together with the present value of future gross premiums, the present value of future benefits, settlement 
and maintenance costs are considered in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs related to the Company’s Life business.","Acquisition costs, comprising only incremental brokerage fees, commissions and excise taxes, which vary directly with, and are related to, the acquisition of reinsurance contracts, are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium is earned. Actual and anticipated losses and loss expenses, other costs and investment income related to underlying premiums are considered in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs related to the Company’s Non-life business."
Item 8,(d) Funds Held by Reinsured Companies (Cedants),"The Company writes certain business on a funds held basis. Under such contractual arrangements, the cedant retains the premiums that would have otherwise been paid to the Company and the Company earns interest on these funds. With the exception of those arrangements discussed below, the Company generally earns investment income on the funds held balances based upon a predetermined interest rate, either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized index (e.g., LIBOR).
In certain circumstances, the Company may receive an investment return based upon either the result of a pool of assets held by the cedant, generally used to collateralize the funds held balance, or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire investment portfolio. In these arrangements, gross investment returns are typically reflected in net investment income with a corresponding increase or decrease (net of a spread) being recorded as life policy benefits in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. In these arrangements, the Company is exposed, to a limited extent, to the underlying credit risk of the pool of assets inasmuch as the underlying life policies may have guaranteed minimum returns. In such cases, an embedded derivative exists and its fair value is recorded by the Company as an increase or decrease to the funds held balance.","Under such contractual arrangements, the cedant retains the premiums that would have otherwise been paid to the Company and the Company earns interest on these funds.

In these arrangements, the Company is exposed, to a limited extent, to the underlying credit risk of the pool of assets inasmuch as the underlying life policies may have guaranteed minimum returns."
Item 8,(e) Deposit Assets and Liabilities,"In the normal course of its operations, the Company writes certain contracts that do not meet the risk transfer provisions of U.S. GAAP. While these contracts do not meet risk transfer provisions for accounting purposes, there is a remote possibility that the Company will suffer a loss. The Company accounts for these contracts using the deposit accounting method, originally recording deposit liabilities for an amount equivalent to the consideration received. The consideration to be retained by the Company, irrespective of the experience of the contracts, is earned over the expected settlement period of the contracts, with any unearned portion recorded as a component of deposit liabilities. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final liabilities under these contracts and the appropriate accretion rates to increase or decrease the liabilities over the term of the contracts. The change for the period is recorded in other income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Under some of these contracts, cedants retain the assets on a funds-held basis. In those cases, the Company records those assets as deposit assets and records the related income in net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.","In the normal course of its operations, the Company writes certain contracts that do not meet the risk transfer provisions of U.S. GAAP.

The change for the period is recorded in other income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations."
Item 8,(f) Investments,"The Company elects the fair value option for all of its fixed maturities, short-term investments, equities and certain other invested assets (excluding those that are accounted for using the cost or equity methods of accounting). All changes in the fair value of investments are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company measures the fair value of financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between the hierarchy levels at the beginning of the period. See Note 3 for additional information on fair value.
Short-term investments comprise securities with a maturity greater than three months but less than one year from the date of purchase.
Other invested assets consist primarily of investments in non-publicly traded companies, private placement equity and fixed maturity investments, derivative financial instruments and other specialty asset classes. Non-publicly traded entities in which the Company has an ownership of more than 20% and less than 50% of the voting shares, and limited partnerships in which the Company has more than a minor interest, are accounted for using either the equity method or the fair value option. The remaining other invested assets are recorded based on valuation techniques depending on the nature of the individual assets. The valuation techniques used by the Company are generally commensurate with standard valuation techniques for each asset class.
Net investment income includes interest and dividend income, amortization of premiums and discounts on fixed maturities and short-term investments and investment income on funds held and funds held – directly managed, and is net of investment expenses and withholding taxes. Investment income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses on the disposal of investments are determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Investment purchases and sales are recorded on a trade-date basis.","The Company elects the fair value option for all of its fixed maturities, short-term investments, equities and certain other invested assets (excluding those that are accounted for using the cost or equity methods of accounting).

Realized gains and losses on the disposal of investments are determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Investment purchases and sales are recorded on a trade-date basis."
Item 8,(g) Funds Held – Directly Managed,"The Company elects the fair value option for substantially all of the fixed maturities, short-term investments and certain other invested assets in the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held – directly managed account. Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held – directly managed account are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.","Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held – directly managed account are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations."
Item 8,(h) Cash and Cash Equivalents,"Cash equivalents are carried at fair value and include fixed income securities that, at purchase, have a maturity of three months or less.","Cash equivalents are carried at fair value and include fixed income securities that, at purchase, have a maturity of three months or less."
Item 8,(i) Business Combinations,"The Company accounts for transactions in which it obtains control over one or more businesses using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including any intangible assets, based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. The estimates of fair values for assets and liabilities acquired are determined based on various market and income analyses and appraisals. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All costs associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred.","The purchase price is allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including any intangible assets, based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. All costs associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred."
Item 8,(j) Goodwill,"Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company assesses the appropriateness of its valuation of goodwill on at least an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If, as a result of the assessment, the Company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired, goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made.","If, as a result of the assessment, the Company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired, goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made."
Item 8,(k) Intangible Assets,"Intangible assets represent the fair value adjustments related to unpaid losses and loss expenses and the fair values of renewal rights, customer relationships and U.S. licenses arising from acquisitions. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The Company recognizes the amortization of all definite-lived intangible assets in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. The carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment on at least an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment is recognized if the carrying values of the intangible assets are not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.",Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment is recognized if the carrying values of the intangible assets are not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.
Item 8,(l) Income Taxes,"Certain subsidiaries and branches of the Company operate in jurisdictions where they are subject to taxation. Current and deferred income taxes are charged or credited to net income or, in certain cases, to accumulated other comprehensive income, based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable in the relevant jurisdiction in the period in which the tax becomes accruable or realizable. Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities used in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and those used in the various jurisdictional tax returns. When Management’s assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit relating to uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. A liability is recognized for any tax benefit (along with any interest and penalty, if applicable) claimed in a tax return in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Any changes in amounts recognized are recorded in the period in which they are determined.

The Company recognizes a tax benefit relating to uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities."
Item 8,(m) Translation of Foreign Currencies,"The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The national currencies of the Company’s subsidiaries and branches are generally their functional currencies, except for the Company’s Bermuda subsidiaries and its Swiss subsidiaries and branch, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In translating the financial statements of those subsidiaries or branches whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are converted into U.S. dollars using the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates, and revenues and expenses are converted using the average foreign exchange rates for the period. The effect of translation adjustments are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
In recording foreign currency transactions, revenue and expense items are converted into the functional currency at the average rates of exchange for the period. Assets and liabilities originating in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are included in net foreign exchange gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company also records realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on certain hedged items in net foreign exchange gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 2(n)).

In recording foreign currency transactions, revenue and expense items are converted into the functional currency at the average rates of exchange for the period."
Item 8,(n) Derivatives,"Derivatives Used in Hedging Activities
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments as part of its overall currency risk management strategy. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivative instruments, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, Management designates whether the derivative is to be used as a hedge of an identified underlying exposure (a designated hedge). The accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of a derivative and the effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on its hedge designation and whether the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged.
The derivatives employed by the Company to hedge currency exposure related to fixed income securities and other reinsurance assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges, with the exception of any hedges of the Company’s net investment in certain subsidiaries and branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. The changes in fair value of these derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in net foreign exchange gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As part of its overall strategy to manage its level of currency exposure, from time to time the Company uses forward foreign exchange derivatives to hedge or partially hedge the net investment in certain subsidiaries and branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges, and accordingly, the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to foreign currency are recognized in currency translation adjustment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also uses, from time to time, interest rate derivatives to mitigate exposure to interest rate volatility.
The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the asset or liability that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item. The Company formally measures effectiveness of its designated hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. The Company assesses the effectiveness of its designated hedges using the period-to-period dollar offset method on an individual currency basis. If the ratio obtained with this method is within the range of 80% to 125%, the Company considers the hedge effective. The time value component of the designated net investment hedges is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of a hedged item. To the extent that the Company discontinues hedge accounting related to its net investment in subsidiaries and branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar, because, based on Management’s assessment, the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, with changes in its fair value recognized in net foreign exchange gains and losses.
Other Derivatives
The Company’s investment strategy allows for the use of derivative instruments, subject to strict limitations. The Company utilizes various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, futures contracts, to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities (TBAs) and credit default swaps for the purpose of managing overall currency risk, market exposures and portfolio duration, for hedging certain investments, or for enhancing investment performance that would be allowed under the Company’s investment policy if implemented in other ways. These instruments are recorded at fair value as assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are included in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, except changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts which are included in net foreign exchange gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Margin balances required by counterparties, which are equal to a percentage of the total value of open futures contracts, are included in cash and cash equivalents.
The Company enters from time to time into weather and longevity related transactions that are structured as derivatives, which are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value reported in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company enters from time to time into total return and interest rate swaps. Margins related to these swaps are included in other income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and any changes in the fair value of the swaps are included in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Item 8,(o) Treasury Shares,"Common shares repurchased by the Company and not canceled are classified as treasury shares, and are recorded at cost. This results in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When shares are reissued from treasury, the Company uses the average cost method to determine the cost of the reissued shares. Gains on sales of treasury shares are credited to additional paid-in capital, while losses are charged to additional paid-in capital to the extent that previous net gains from sales of treasury shares are included therein, otherwise losses are charged to retained earnings.
","Common shares repurchased by the Company and not canceled are classified as treasury shares, and are recorded at cost. This results in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets."
Item 8,(p) Net Income or Loss per Common Share,"Diluted net income or loss per common share is defined as net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method for all potentially dilutive securities. Net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders is defined as net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. less preferred share dividends. When the effect of dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive, these securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income or loss per share. Basic net income or loss per share is defined as net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, giving no effect to dilutive securities.","Diluted net income or loss per common share is defined as net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method for all potentially dilutive securities. Net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. common shareholders is defined as net income or loss attributable to PartnerRe Ltd. less preferred share dividends."
Item 8,(q) Share-Based Compensation,"The Company currently uses six types of share-based compensation: share options, restricted shares (RS), restricted share units (RSUs), performance-based RSUs (PSUs), share-settled share appreciation rights (SSARs) and shares issued under the Company’s employee share purchase plans.
The majority of the Company’s share-based compensation awards qualify for equity classification. The fair value of the compensation cost is measured at the grant date and is expensed over the period for which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Awards of PSUs provide performance-based equity awards based on pre-established targets relating to certain performance measures achieved by the Company. The compensation expense for PSUs is initially based on the target performance measure at the time of award and is subject to periodic review and adjustment based on expected actual performance. Forfeiture benefits on all awards are estimated at the time of grant and incorporated in the determination of share-based compensation costs. Awards granted to employees who are eligible for retirement and do not have to provide additional services are expensed at the date of grant.
Those share-based compensation awards that do not meet the equity classification criteria are classified as liability awards. Liability-classified awards are recorded at fair value in the Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value relating to the vested portion of the award recorded within Other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.","The Company currently uses six types of share-based compensation: share options, restricted shares (RS), restricted share units (RSUs), performance-based RSUs (PSUs), share-settled share appreciation rights (SSARs) and shares issued under the Company’s employee share purchase plans.

Item 8,(r) Pensions,"The Company recognizes an asset or a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the funded status of its defined benefit plans that are overfunded or underfunded, respectively, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the pension obligation and recognizes changes in the funded status of defined benefit plans in the year in which the changes occur as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.","The Company recognizes an asset or a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the funded status of its defined benefit plans that are overfunded or underfunded, respectively, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the pension obligation and recognizes changes in the funded status of defined benefit plans in the year in which the changes occur as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax."
Item 8,(s) Variable Interest Entities and Noncontrolling Interests,"The Company is involved in the normal course of business with variable interest entities (VIEs) as a passive investor in certain limited partnerships, fixed maturity investments and asset-backed securities, that are issued by third party VIEs. The Company performs a qualitative assessment at the date when it becomes initially involved in the VIE followed by ongoing reassessments related to its involvement in VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the amounts invested in and advanced to the VIEs at December 31, 2014 that are reported within fixed maturities and other invested assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and any unfunded commitments.
The Company also has three indirect 100% owned subsidiaries, PartnerRe Finance A LLC, PartnerRe Finance B LLC and PartnerRe Finance II Inc., that are considered to be VIEs, which were utilized to issue the Company’s Senior Notes and Capital Efficient Notes (CENts). The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs at December 31, 2014. As a result, the Company has not consolidated PartnerRe Finance A LLC, PartnerRe Finance B LLC and PartnerRe Finance II Inc., and has reflected the debt issued by the Company related to the Senior Notes and CENts as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 10). The interest on the debt related to the Senior Notes and CENts is reported as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company has also formed a subsidiary with other third party investors, Lorenz Re Ltd. (Lorenz Re), that is considered to be a VIE. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary as it has the power to direct and has more than an insignificant economic interest in the activities of Lorenz Re. Lorenz Re is consolidated by the Company and all inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. Net income or loss and shareholders’ equity attributable to Lorenz Re’s third party investors are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as noncontrolling interests (see Note 13).","The Company is involved in the normal course of business with variable interest entities (VIEs) as a passive investor in certain limited partnerships, fixed maturity investments and asset-backed securities, that are issued by third party VIEs.

Item 8,(t) Segment Reporting,"The Company monitors the performance of its operations in three segments, Non-life, Life and Health and Corporate and Other. The Non-life segment is further divided into four sub-segments: North America, Global (Non-U.S.) Property and Casualty (Global (Non-U.S.) P&C), Global Specialty and Catastrophe.
Segments and sub-segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography, client types, buying patterns, underlying risk patterns or approach to risk management.","The Non-life segment is further divided into four sub-segments: North America, Global (Non-U.S.) Property and Casualty (Global (Non-U.S.) P&C), Global Specialty and Catastrophe."
Item 8,(u) Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance on the accounting for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits by entities that manage or invest in such projects. The update modifies the conditions that an entity must meet to elect the effective yield or proportional amortization method to account for such investments. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.
In June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.
In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities.

Item 8,(b) Paris Re Reserve Agreement,"Following Paris Re’s acquisition of substantially all of the reinsurance operations of Colisée Re in 2006, Paris Re’s French operating subsidiary (Paris Re France) entered into a reserve agreement (Reserve Agreement), which provides that AXA and Colisée Re shall guarantee reserves in respect of Paris Re France and subsidiaries acquired in the acquisition. The Reserve Agreement relates to losses incurred prior to December 31, 2005. Accordingly, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations do not include any favorable or adverse development related to these guaranteed reserves. The reserve guarantee provided by AXA and Colisée Re is conditioned upon, among other things, the guaranteed business, including all related ceded reinsurance, being managed by AXA Liabilities Managers, an affiliate of Colisée Re.
Favorable or adverse development related to the guaranteed reserves is recorded as a change in unpaid losses and loss expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a change in the Reserve Agreement payable or receivable balance to/from 
Colisée Re, which is included within the Funds held – directly managed account in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Accordingly, the reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross and net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 includes the change in the Reserve Agreement. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company’s net liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses includes $575 million and $727 million, respectively, of guaranteed reserves, with the decrease from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 being primarily related to the commutation of a portion of the Reserve Agreement with Colisée Re, the run-off of the underlying loss reserves associated with this account and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies.","The Reserve Agreement relates to losses incurred prior to December 31, 2005.

Item 8,(c) Claims Related to Catastrophic Events,"A significant amount of judgment was used to estimate the range of potential losses related to the 2010 and the February and June 2011 New Zealand earthquakes (collectively, the New Zealand Earthquakes) and the Japan earthquake in 2011, and there remains a considerable degree of uncertainty related to the range of possible ultimate losses associated with these events and, in particular, the New Zealand Earthquakes. Loss estimates arising from earthquakes are inherently more uncertain than those from other catastrophic events and the Company believes the ultimate losses arising from the New Zealand Earthquakes may be materially in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014.
The remaining significant risks and uncertainties related to the New Zealand Earthquakes include the ongoing cedant revisions of loss estimates for each of these events, the degree to which inflation impacts construction materials required to rebuild affected properties, the characteristics of the Company’s program participation for certain affected cedants and potentially affected cedants, and the expected length of the claims settlement period. In addition, there is further complexity related to the New Zealand Earthquakes given multiple earthquakes occurred in the same region in a relatively short period of time, resulting in cedants continuing to review and revise their allocation of losses between the various events and between different treaties, under which the Company may provide different amounts of coverage.

Item 8,(d) Asbestos and Environmental Claims,"The Company’s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $189 million and $193 million, respectively, that represent estimates of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims. The gross liability for such claims at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $201 million and $203 million, respectively, which primarily relate to Paris Re’s gross liability for asbestos and environmental claims for accident years 2005 and prior of $127 million and $123 million, respectively, with any favorable or adverse development being subject to the Reserve Agreement. Of the remaining $74 million and $80 million in gross reserves at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the majority relates to casualty exposures in the United States arising from business written by the French branch of PartnerRe Europe and PartnerRe U.S.
Ultimate loss estimates for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses for these claims. In view of the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims, the uncertainties inherent in estimating asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future. There can be no assurance that the reserves established by the Company will not be adversely affected by development of other latent exposures, and further, there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the Company will be adequate. The Company does, however, actively evaluate potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional reserves as appropriate. The Company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its unpaid losses and loss expense reserves related to this exposure.","The gross liability for such claims at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $201 million and $203 million, respectively, which primarily relate to Paris Re’s gross liability for asbestos and environmental claims for accident years 2005 and prior of $127 million and $123 million, respectively, with any favorable or adverse development being subject to the Reserve Agreement.

Item 8,(e) Policy Benefits for Life and Annuity Contracts,"The Life and Health segment reported net favorable loss development for prior accident years of $19 million, $39 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The net favorable prior year loss development of $19 million in 2014 was primarily related to the guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) business, PartnerRe Health and certain short-term treaties in the mortality line of business.
The net favorable prior year loss development of $39 million in 2013 was primarily related to the GMDB business and, to a lesser extent, certain short-term treaties in the mortality line of business. The net favorable development was primarily due to favorable claims experience, data updates received from cedants and improvements in the capital markets related to the GMDB business.
The net favorable prior year loss development of $14 million in 2012 was primarily related to the GMDB business, mainly driven by improvements in the capital markets, and certain short-term treaties in the mortality line of business. 
The Company used interest rate assumptions to estimate its liabilities for policy benefits for life and annuity contracts which ranged from 0% to 6.8% and 0.1% to 6.8% at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.","The Life and Health segment reported net favorable loss development for prior accident years of $19 million, $39 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Item 1,Insurance Regulation,"The insurance laws and regulations, as well as the level of supervisory authority that may be exercised by the various state insurance departments, vary by jurisdiction. These laws and regulations generally: Grant broad powers to supervisory agencies or regulators to examine and supervise insurance companies and insurance holding companies with respect to every significant aspect of the conduct of the insurance business. This includes the power to pre-approve the execution or modification of contractual arrangements.Require insurance companies to meet certain solvency standards and asset tests, to maintain minimum standards of financial strength and to file certain reports with regulatory authorities (including information concerning their capital structure, ownership and financial condition). Subject insurers to potential assessments for amounts paid by guarantee funds.
RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re and RCM are subject to the state of Missouri’s adoption of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Model Audit Rule, which requires an insurer to have an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant, provide an annual management report of internal control over financial reporting, file the resulting reports with the Director of Insurance and maintain an audit committee. Aurora National is subject to similar regulation by the State of California.
The Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Acts in the U.S. permit the Missouri regulator to request and consider similar information in its regulation of the solvency of and capital standards for RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re and RCM. In addition, the California regulator is permitted to request and consider in its regulation of the solvency of and capital standards for Aurora National, information about the operations of other subsidiaries of RGA and the extent to which contagion risk posed by those operations may also exist.
In addition, RGA is subject to a supervisory college, conducted by its group supervisor the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance (“MDCI”). The supervisory college is comprised of insurance regulators of the major jurisdictions in which RGA has established insurance branches and subsidiaries. Since the inception of the supervisory college in October 2012, the MDCI has conducted regular in-person supervisory college meetings in addition to numerous regulator-only conference calls. These meetings bring about requests for information from RGA’s regulators as they monitor RGA’s solvency, governance and overall management. While the supervisory college has the ability to impose limitations on the activities of the insurance subsidiaries of RGA, particularly since RGA has met the requirements to become an internationally active insurance group, no such limitations have been imposed to date. The existence of the supervisory college generally helps RGA’s regulators understand its business to a greater degree and encourages a more global view by RGA of its own regulation.
RGA’s reinsurance subsidiaries are required to file statutory financial statements in each jurisdiction in which they are licensed and may be subject to onsite, periodic examinations by the insurance regulators of the jurisdictions in which each is licensed, authorized, or accredited. To date, none of the regulators’ reports related to the Company’s periodic examinations have contained material adverse findings.
Although some of the rates and policy terms of U.S. direct insurance agreements are regulated by state insurance departments, the rates, policy terms, and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any regulatory authority, which is also true outside of the U.S. In the U.S., however, the NAIC Model Law on Credit for Reinsurance, which has been adopted in most states, imposes certain requirements for an insurer to take reserve credit for risk ceded to a reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer is required to be licensed, accredited or certified in the insurer’s state of domicile, or post security for reserves transferred to the reinsurer in the form of letters of credit or assets placed in trust. A forthcoming alternative will allow a U.S. domiciled insurer to obtain credit for the reserves it cedes to what will be termed a “reciprocal reinsurer.” A reciprocal reinsurer is a reinsurer that is domiciled in a jurisdiction that observes the standards established in the U.S.-EU-Covered Agreement or a similar bi-lateral trade agreement dealing with reinsurance. Insurers ceding business to reciprocal reinsurers will be permitted to take reserve credit without the reinsurer having to establish security. The NAIC Life and Health Reinsurance Agreements Model Regulation, which has been adopted in most states, imposes additional requirements for insurers to claim reserve credit for reinsurance ceded (excluding yearly renewable term reinsurance and non-proportional reinsurance). These requirements include bona fide risk transfer, an insolvency clause, written agreements, and filing of reinsurance agreements involving in force business, among other things. Outside of the U.S., rules for reinsurance and requirements for minimum risk transfer are less specific and are less likely to be published as rules, but nevertheless standards can be imposed to varying extents.
U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), implemented in the U.S. for various types of life insurance business, significantly increased the level of reserves that U.S. life insurance and life reinsurance companies must hold on their statutory financial statements for various types of life insurance business, primarily certain level premium term life products. The reserve levels required under Regulation XXX are normally in excess of reserves required under GAAP. In situations where primary insurers have reinsured business to reinsurers that are unlicensed and unaccredited in the U.S., the reinsurer must provide collateral equal to its reinsurance reserves in order for the ceding company to receive statutory financial statement credit. Reinsurers have historically utilized letters of credit for the benefit of the ceding company, or have placed assets in trust for the benefit of the ceding company, or have used other structures as the primary forms of collateral. An exception to this requirement will soon exist for reinsurance ceded to reciprocal reinsurers.
    RGA Reinsurance is the primary subsidiary of the Company subject to Regulation XXX. In order to manage the effect of Regulation XXX on its statutory financial statements, RGA Reinsurance has retroceded a majority of Regulation XXX reserves to unaffiliated and affiliated unlicensed reinsurers and special purpose reinsurers, or captives. RGA Reinsurance’s statutory capital may be significantly reduced if the unaffiliated or affiliated reinsurer is unable to provide the required collateral to support RGA Reinsurance’s statutory reserve credits and RGA Reinsurance cannot find an alternative source for the collateral. The NAIC has requirements for life insurers using special purpose reinsurers. While RGA Reinsurance’s reserve financing arrangements using special purpose reinsurers or “captive reinsurers” are permitted, the rules place limitations on RGA Reinsurance’s ability to utilize captive reinsurers to finance reserve growth related to future business. Such limitations have caused the Company to utilize alternative retrocession strategies, primarily involving the use of a certified reinsurer as discussed below.
Based on the growth of the Company’s business and the pattern of reserve levels under Regulation XXX associated with term life business and other statutory reserve requirements, the amount of ceded reserve credits is expected to grow, albeit, with the implementation of principles-based reserves in the U.S. growth is expected at slower rates than in the immediate past. This growth will require the Company to obtain additional letters of credit, put additional assets in trust, or utilize other funding mechanisms to support reserve credits. If the Company is unable to support the reserve credits, the regulatory capital levels of several of its subsidiaries may be significantly reduced, while the regulatory capital requirements for these subsidiaries would not change. The reduction in regulatory capital could affect the Company’s ability to write new business and retain existing business.
Affiliated captives are commonly used in the insurance industry to help manage statutory reserve and collateral requirements and are often domiciled in the same state as the insurance company that sponsors the captive. The NAIC has analyzed the insurance industry’s use of affiliated captive reinsurers to satisfy certain reserve requirements and has adopted measures to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such reinsurers. Current standards addressing the use of captive reinsurers allow captives organized prior to 2016 to continue in accordance with their currently approved plans. State insurance regulators that regulate the Company’s domestic insurance companies have placed additional restrictions on the use of newly established captive reinsurers, which may increase costs and add complexity. As a result, the Company may need to alter the type and volume of business it reinsures, increase prices on those products, raise additional capital to support higher regulatory reserves or implement higher cost strategies.
In the U.S., the introduction of the certified reinsurer has provided an alternative way to manage regulatory reserves and collateral requirements. In 2014, RGA Americas was designated as a certified reinsurer by the MDCI. This designation allows the Company to retrocede business to RGA Americas in lieu of using captives for collateral requirements. Beginning in 2017, the NAIC approved principles-based reserving for U.S. insurers; however, implementation required approval by the states. To achieve this, the NAIC amended the standard valuation law to adopt life principles-based reserving (PBR) that was effective January 1, 2017, allowing a three-year adoption period. The Company adopted PBR in 2020, and PBR reserves are determined based on the terms of the reinsurance agreement which may differ from those of the direct policies. The Company has chosen not to establish captives subject to the new regulations as it evaluates the impact of the regulations on new captives, and how these new captives fit into the Company’s overall risk management and financing programs.
Reinsurers may place assets in trust to satisfy collateral requirements for certain treaties. In addition, the Company holds securities in trust to satisfy collateral requirements under certain third-party reinsurance treaties. Under certain conditions in some treaties, the Company may be obligated to move reinsurance from one subsidiary of RGA to another subsidiary, post additional collateral for the ceding insurer or allow the ceding insurer to cancel the reinsurance. These conditions include change in control, level of capital or ratings of the subsidiary, insolvency, nonperformance under a treaty, or loss of the subsidiary’s reinsurance license. If the Company is ever required to perform under these obligations, the risk to the consolidated company under the reinsurance treaties would not change; however, additional capital may be required due to the change in jurisdiction of the subsidiary reinsuring the business and may create a strain on liquidity, possibly causing a reduction in dividend payments or hampering the Company’s ability to write new business or retain existing business. In the event that a treaty is terminated, the future profits related to the terminated treaty may be lost.
RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re, Castlewood Re and RCM prepare statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Missouri. Timberlake Re prepares statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of South Carolina. Aurora National prepares its statutory financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of California. Each of these states require domestic insurance companies to prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual subject to any deviations permitted by each state’s insurance commissioner. The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the regulations and reporting requirements of their respective countries of domicile.

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the regulations and reporting requirements of their respective countries of domicile."
Item 1,Capital Requirements,"Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) guidelines promulgated by the NAIC are applicable to RGA Reinsurance, RCM, Aurora National, and Chesterfield Re, and identify minimum capital requirements based upon business levels and asset mix. These subsidiaries maintain capital levels in excess of the amounts required by the applicable guidelines. Timberlake Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re and Castlewood Re’s capital requirements are determined solely by their licensing orders issued by their states of domicile. Pursuant to its licensing order issued by the South Carolina Department of Insurance, Timberlake Re only calculates RBC as a means of demonstrating its ability to pay principal and interest on its surplus note issued to Timberlake Financial, L.L.C. (“Timberlake Financial”). It is not otherwise subject to the RBC guidelines. Similarly, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re and Castlewood Re are not subject to the requirements of the NAIC’s RBC guidelines. A decline in the RBC of one or more of the Company’s U.S. insurers can cause the appearance of less capitalization in its U.S. insurers, individually, or when considered as a group.
While the NAIC is still developing its group capital calculation and has not yet articulated the ways in which it intends U.S. states to use the calculation, the calculation is expected to be used to assess the adequacy of capital within an insurance group domiciled in the U.S., particularly for groups such as RGA that are designated an Internationally Active Insurance Group (“IAIG”) by the group supervisor. The Company cannot currently predict the effect that any proposed or future group capital standard will have on its financial condition or operations or the financial condition or operations of its subsidiaries.
Regulations in international jurisdictions also require certain minimum capital levels, and subject the companies operating in such jurisdictions, to oversight by the applicable regulatory bodies. RGA’s subsidiaries meet the minimum capital requirements in their respective jurisdictions. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors continues work on its insurance capital standard. While the insurance capital standard is a model for capital standards and not a standard that must be followed on its own in any jurisdiction, it is likely to influence capital requirements for insurers around the world and may lead to a need for additional capital in one or more of RGA’s subsidiaries. The Company cannot predict the effect that any proposed or future legislation or rulemaking in the countries in which it operates may have on the financial condition or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries.","Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) guidelines promulgated by the NAIC are applicable to RGA Reinsurance, RCM, Aurora National, and Chesterfield Re, and identify minimum capital requirements based upon business levels and asset mix.

Item 1,Insurance Holding Company Regulations,"RGA Reinsurance, Chesterfield Re, Parkway Re, Rockwood Re, Castlewood Re and RCM are subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of Missouri. Aurora National is subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of California. These insurance holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file with the home state regulator certain reports describing, among other information, capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, and general business operations. The insurance holding company statutes and regulations also require prior approval of, or in certain circumstances, prior notice to the home state regulator of, certain material intercompany transfers of assets, as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, their parent companies and affiliates.
    Under current Missouri and California insurance laws and regulations, no person may acquire any voting security or security convertible into a voting security of an insurance holding company, such as RGA, if as a result of the acquisition such person would “control” the insurance holding company. “Control” is presumed to exist under Missouri and California law if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Changes in control of an insurer are not permitted under the laws of these states unless: (i) certain filings are made with the home state regulator, (ii) certain requirements are met, including a public hearing, and (iii) approval or exemption is granted by the home state regulator.  Additionally, revisions to the insurance holding company regulations of Missouri and California require increased disclosure to regulators of matters within the RGA group of companies.","Aurora National is subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of California.

Item 1,Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions,"Current Missouri law, applicable to RCM and its subsidiaries, RGA Reinsurance and Chesterfield Re, permits the payment of dividends or distributions that together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year. Any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is considered an “extraordinary dividend” and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the Director of the MDCI. Additionally, dividends may be paid only to the extent the insurer has unassigned surplus (as opposed to contributed surplus). The regulatory limitations and other restrictions described herein could limit the Company’s financial flexibility in the future should it choose to or need to use subsidiary dividends as a funding source for its obligations. See Note 11 – “Financial Condition and Net Income on a Statutory Basis – Significant Subsidiaries” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s dividend restrictions.
The California Insurance Holding Company Act defines an extraordinary dividend consistent with the definition found in the Missouri Insurance Holding Company Act and imposes an identical restriction upon the ability of Aurora National to pay dividends to RGA Reinsurance. In contrast to both the Missouri and the California Insurance Holding Company Acts, the NAIC Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act defines an extraordinary dividend as a dividend or distribution that together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or (ii) statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year. The Company is unable to predict whether, when, or if, Missouri will enact a new regulation for extraordinary dividends.
Missouri insurance laws and regulations also require that the statutory surplus of Chesterfield Re, RCM and RGA Reinsurance following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet their financial needs. The Director of the MDCI may call for a rescission of the payment of a dividend or distribution by these entities that would cause their statutory surplus to be inadequate under the standards of the Missouri insurance regulations. California insurance laws and regulations impose the same restrictions on Aurora National as to the dividends or distributions that are made.
Pursuant to the South Carolina Director of Insurance, Timberlake Re may declare dividends subject to a minimum Total Adjusted Capital threshold, as defined by the NAIC’s RBC regulation. As of December 31, 2020, Timberlake Re met the minimum required threshold. Any dividends paid by Timberlake Re would be paid to Timberlake Financial, which in turn is subject to contractual limitations on the amount of dividends it can pay to RCM.
Dividend payments from non-U.S. operations are subject to similar restrictions established by local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent to a portion of the prior year’s statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of the Company’s non-U.S. operations may also limit or prohibit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of the non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries that are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow to RGA.

Most of the non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries that are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies."
Item 1,Default or Liquidation,"In the event that RGA defaults on any of its debt or other obligations, or becomes the subject of bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization proceedings, the creditors and stockholders of RGA will have no right to proceed against the assets of any of the subsidiaries of RGA. If any of RGA’s reinsurance subsidiaries were to be liquidated or dissolved, the liquidation or dissolution would be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the appropriate governing body in the state or country of the subsidiary’s domicile. The creditors of any such reinsurance company, including, without limitation, holders of its reinsurance agreements and state guaranty associations (if applicable), would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before RGA, as a direct or indirect stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distributions or other payments from the remaining assets of the liquidated or dissolved subsidiary.","The creditors of any such reinsurance company, including, without limitation, holders of its reinsurance agreements and state guaranty associations (if applicable), would be entitled to payment in full from such assets before RGA, as a direct or indirect stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distributions or other payments from the remaining assets of the liquidated or dissolved subsidiary."
Item 1,Federal Regulation,"Since the 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, there has been renewed interest by the U.S. federal government in the manner in which insurance and reinsurance is regulated. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury Department has negotiated a “covered agreement” with the European Union. The covered agreement, while promoting the recognition of U.S. state insurance regulators as group supervisors of U.S.-based global reinsurers such as RGA, also provides for an elimination of the collateral that reinsurers based in the European Union by 2022, and by NAIC’s anticipated extension of the rules, to those reinsurers based in Bermuda and Switzerland, the elimination of the collateral that reinsurers domiciled in those jurisdictions must currently post in favor of U.S. ceding insurers. This agreement, coupled with new state credit for reinsurance laws, has the potential to lower the cost at which RGA Reinsurance’s competitors are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers. Additionally under the Dodd-Frank Act, one or more of RGA’s client ceding insurers domiciled in the U.S. may from time-to-time be designated for solvency supervision by the Federal Reserve.
    Insurers can be designated systemically important so as to warrant the imposition of an additional layer of regulation over already existing state regulation. While it is not expected that any RGA entity would be deemed to be systemically important and become subject to this additional scrutiny, the reinsurance programs RGA maintains with the insurers so designated as systemically important are subject to scrutiny by the Federal Reserve. While no U.S. insurers or reinsurers are currently designated systemically important, it is possible that one or more of RGA’s clients will be given this designation in the future leading to additional scrutiny of those clients’ reinsurance programs by the Federal Reserve. With the potential regulation of some U.S. domiciled insurers by the U.S. government, it is possible that the scope of the federal government’s ability to regulate insurers and reinsurers will be expanded. It is not possible to predict the effect of such decisions or changes in law on the operation of the Company, but the Dodd-Frank Act makes it more likely than in the past that insurance or reinsurance may be regulated at the federal level. A shift in regulation from the state to the federal level may bring into question the continued validity of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts the “business of insurance” from most federal laws, including anti-trust laws. With the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption for the business of insurance, a reinsurer may set rate, underwriting and claims handling standards for its ceding company clients to follow.
","Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Treasury Department has negotiated a “covered agreement” with the European Union. The covered agreement, while promoting the recognition of U.S. state insurance regulators as group supervisors of U.S.-based global reinsurers such as RGA, also provides for an elimination of the collateral that reinsurers based in the European Union by 2022, and by NAIC’s anticipated extension of the rules, to those reinsurers based in Bermuda and Switzerland, the elimination of the collateral that reinsurers domiciled in those jurisdictions must currently post in favor of U.S. ceding insurers. While it is not expected that any RGA entity would be deemed to be systemically important and become subject to this additional scrutiny, the reinsurance programs RGA maintains with the insurers so designated as systemically important are subject to scrutiny by the Federal Reserve. While no U.S. insurers or reinsurers are currently designated systemically important, it is possible that one or more of RGA’s clients will be given this designation in the future leading to additional scrutiny of those clients’ reinsurance programs by the Federal Reserve. With the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption for the business of insurance, a reinsurer may set rate, underwriting and claims handling standards for its ceding company clients to follow."
Item 1,Environmental Considerations,"Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to the Company’s ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), the Company may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to it. The Company also risks environmental liability when it forecloses on a property mortgaged to it, although federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose the Company to CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on the Company for costs associated with environmental hazards.
In addition to conducting an environmental assessment while underwriting a mortgage loan, the Company routinely conducts environmental assessments prior to taking title to real estate through foreclosure on real estate collateralizing mortgages that it holds. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments and complying with its internal procedures, and as a result, the Company believes that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.","Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to the Company’s ownership and operation of real property.

Item 1,International Regulation,"RGA’s international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate branch offices. The regulation includes minimum capital, solvency and governance requirements. The authority of RGA’s international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, inspections and approvals and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of the insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, risk management processes and governance procedures are among the techniques used by regulators to supervise RGA’s non-U.S. insurance businesses. The regulators of RGA’s non-U.S. insurance companies, and the California Department of Insurance are also invited to be part of the supervisory college held by the MDCI, RGA’s group supervisor.
The Company’s subsidiaries domiciled in Bermuda are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). Such regulation includes rules regarding privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control in addition to insurance regulation. To that end, the BMA has broad powers to regulate business activities of the Company’s Bermuda domiciled subsidiaries, mandate capital and surplus requirements, regulate trade and claims practices and require strong enterprise risk management and corporate governance activities. The Company’s subsidiaries domiciled in Barbados are subject to regulation and supervision by the Financial Services Commission in Barbados. Recently enacted economic substance requirements in Bermuda and Barbados may place additional requirements, including reporting requirements, on the Company’s subsidiaries domiciled in those countries in order to demonstrate purpose and governance of those entities and their operations to greater levels than required in the past.
Much like the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S., regulators around the world continue to consider ways to avoid a recurrence of the causes of the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis. A group leading this effort is the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”). The FSB consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB and related governmental bodies have developed proposals to address issues such as group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk and corporate governance, including executive compensation and many other related issues associated with the financial crisis. At the direction of the FSB, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) has developed a model framework for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (“IAIG”) that contemplates “group-wide supervision” across national boundaries. RGA now qualifies as an IAIG bringing about requirements for RGA to conduct a group-wide risk and solvency assessment to monitor and manage its overall solvency. At this time RGA cannot predict what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements would impose on it, if adopted for the evaluation of a U.S.- domiciled insurance group. There is also the potential for inconsistent or conflicting regulation of the RGA group of companies as lawmakers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives.
Additionally, RGA International, operating in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), is subject to the Solvency II measures developed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and will be required to abide by the evolving risk management practices, capital standards and disclosure requirements of the Solvency II framework. Additionally, the Company’s clients located in the EEA will need to abide by these standards in operating their insurance businesses, including the management of their ceded reinsurance. Currently, insurers and reinsurers located in the EEA are operating under Solvency II. The Company expects Solvency II to have a significant influence on not only the regulation of solvency measures applied to insurers and reinsurers operating within the EEA, but the Company also expects the solvency regulation measures to influence future regulatory structures of countries outside of the EEA, including Japan. Influences of the Solvency II – type framework are already present in the insurance regulation of Bermuda and China and currently influence the solvency measures imposed upon RGA Global and RGA Americas.
As a result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, under which the United Kingdom (“UK”) exited the European Union effective January 31, 2020, the regulatory approval of RGA International as a reinsurer of insurance business written by UK domiciled insurers remains susceptible to termination after the end of 2020. While it currently appears that any post Brexit insurance regulation in the UK will permit the separate registration of RGA International as a branch in the UK, there exists questions as to what requirements will be imposed upon reinsurers domiciled outside of the UK after implementation of the Brexit initiative.
New and proposed restrictions in many European and Asian countries on RGA’s ability to transfer data from one country to another also threaten to make its operations less efficient. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which establishes uniform data privacy laws across the European Union (“EU”) is effective for all EU member states and is extraterritorial in that it applies to EU entities, as well as entities established in the EU that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EU or monitor consumer behavior that takes place in the EU. The GDPR anticipates the processing of data for reinsurance and other purposes and applies standards and rules that covered entities must establish and monitor with respect to such processing and use. Many of the restrictions enacted by jurisdictions outside of the EU either do not anticipate the processing of data for reinsurance purposes at all or place costly restrictions on the ability of a reinsurer to service its business by requiring processing to be done within the borders of the country in which the insured consumer resides.
Additionally, some countries limit the amount of insurance business that can be ceded to foreign reinsurers. Requirements of this type are proposed from time-to-time in developing markets. These forced localization requirements have the impact of limiting the amount of reinsurance business RGA can conduct in those countries without the participation of a local reinsurer.
RGA expects the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as group regulatory oversight generally, to continue to increase.

Item 1,Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation,"Various jurisdictions in which the Company’s subsidiaries and their clients operate have established laws protecting the privacy and handling of consumers’ private data. The area of cybersecurity has also come under increased scrutiny from insurance regulators. These laws and regulations vary country to country and state to state, but they generally require the establishment of programs to detect and prevent unauthorized access to personal data and to mitigate theft of personal data. They also may require the Company, among other things, to notify client insurers or individuals of any security breach involving protected data, and to provide individuals with the right to access personal data and with the right to be forgotten.
    In the U.S. the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law which establishes standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification of insurance regulators of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to certain private information belonging to insureds. To date, this Model Law has not been widely adopted, but the Company expects further adoption in the future. The cybersecurity regulation in New York is applicable to many of the Company’s clients, and it requires the Company to demonstrate the existence and soundness of its cybersecurity program to those clients. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) grants all California residents the right to know what information a business has collected from them and the sourcing and sharing of that information. The CCPA also gives the California consumer the right to have a business delete their personal information with some exceptions. The California restrictions, and related exceptions became effective on January 1, 2020. The Company expects that the exceptions will apply to a significant portion of its business. Laws and regulations similar to the New York cybersecurity regulation and the CCPA, as well as measures similar to the NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law are likely to be adopted by more U.S. states in the near future, if not by the U.S. federal government.
    In addition, new and proposed privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in many European and Asian countries restrict RGA’s ability to transfer data and impose other requirements on holders of data. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which establishes uniform data privacy laws across the European Union (“EU”) is effective for all EU member states and is extraterritorial in that it applies to EU entities, as well as entities established in the EU that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EU or monitor consumer behavior that takes place in the EU.

Item 1,Underwriting,"Automatic. The Company’s management determines whether to write automatic reinsurance business by considering many factors, including the types of risks to be covered; the ceding company’s retention limit and binding authority, product, and pricing assumptions; and the ceding company’s underwriting standards, financial strength and distribution systems. For automatic business, the Company ensures that the underwriting standards, procedures and guidelines of its ceding companies are priced appropriately and consistent with the Company’s expectations. To this end, the Company conducts periodic reviews of the ceding companies’ underwriting and claims personnel and procedures.
Facultative. The Company has developed underwriting policies, procedures and standards with the objective of controlling the quality of business written as well as its pricing. The Company’s underwriting process emphasizes close collaboration between its underwriting, actuarial, and administration departments. Management periodically updates these underwriting policies, procedures, and standards to account for changing industry conditions, market developments, and changes occurring in the field of medical technology. These policies, procedures, and standards are documented in electronic underwriting manuals made available to all the Company’s underwriters. The Company regularly performs internal reviews of both its underwriters and underwriting process.
The Company’s management determines whether to accept facultative reinsurance business on a prospective insured by reviewing the application, medical information and other underwriting information appropriate to the age of the prospective insured and the face amount of the application. An assessment of medical and financial history follows with decisions based on underwriting knowledge, manual review and consultation with the Company’s medical directors as necessary. Many facultative applications involve individuals with multiple medical impairments, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, which require a complex underwriting/mortality assessment. The Company employs medical directors and medical consultants to assist its underwriters in making these assessments.

Item 1,Pricing,"The Company has pricing actuaries dedicated in every geographic market and in every product category who develop reinsurance treaty rates following the Company’s policies, procedures and standards. Biometric assumptions are based primarily on the Company’s own mortality, morbidity and persistency experience, reflecting industry and client-specific experience. Economic and asset-related pricing assumptions are based on current and long-term market conditions and are developed by actuarial and investment personnel with appropriate experience and expertise. The Company’s view of short- and long-term risks are reflected in pricing consistent with its internal capital model. For transactional business with material day-one invested assets there is diligence on the expected asset portfolio that is reflected in the pricing assumption. For transactional business focusing on tail risk the Company has policies and procedures related to views on transaction-specific tail risk events. A transaction process ensures that the business reflects the input of internal areas of expertise in deal teams and has procedures for escalation based on the size and nature of the risks. Management has established a high-level oversight of the processes and results of these activities, which includes peer reviews in every market as well as centralized procedures and processes for reviewing and auditing pricing activities.","The Company has pricing actuaries dedicated in every geographic market and in every product category who develop reinsurance treaty rates following the Company’s policies, procedures and standards.

Item 1,Operations,"The Company’s business has been primarily obtained directly, rather than through brokers. The Company has an experienced sales and marketing staff that works to provide responsive service and maintain existing relationships.
The Company’s administration, auditing, valuation and finance departments are responsible for treaty compliance auditing, financial analysis of results, generation of internal management reports, and periodic audits of administrative and underwriting practices. A significant effort is focused on periodic audits of administrative and underwriting practices, and treaty compliance of clients.
The Company’s claims departments review and verify reinsurance claims, obtain the information necessary to evaluate claims, and arrange for timely claims payments. Claims are subjected to a detailed review process to ensure that the risk was properly ceded, the claim complies with the contract provisions, and the ceding company is current in the payment of reinsurance premiums to the Company. In addition, the claims departments monitor both specific claims and the overall claims handling procedures of ceding companies.","The Company has an experienced sales and marketing staff that works to provide responsive service and maintain existing relationships.

Item 1,Customer Base,"The Company provides reinsurance products primarily to the largest life insurance companies in the world. In 2020, the Company’s five largest clients generated approximately $2.7 billion or 21.1% of the Company’s gross premiums and other revenues. In addition, 27 other clients each generated annual gross premiums and other revenues of $100 million or more, and the aggregate gross premiums and other revenues from these clients represented approximately 42.4% of the Company’s gross premiums and other revenues. No individual client generated 10% or more of the Company’s total gross premiums and other revenues. For the purpose of this disclosure, companies that are within the same insurance holding company structure are combined.","In 2020, the Company’s five largest clients generated approximately $2.7 billion or 21.1% of the Company’s gross premiums and other revenues.

Item 1,Competition," New reinsurance opportunities continue to be highly price competitive; however, companies that consistently win business are financially strong, provide flexible terms and conditions, have a positive reputation, deliver excellent service, and demonstrate execution certainty and a long-term commitment to the business underwritten. The Company’s competition includes other reinsurance companies, providers of financial services, and private equity firms. The Company believes that its primary global reinsurance competitors are the following, or their affiliates: Munich Re, Swiss Re, Hannover Re, SCOR Global Re, Athene, Global Atlantic, Wilton Re and Protective Life. In addition, the Company may compete with Pacific Life, Prudential Financial, and Canada Life in select risk acquisition. Within the reinsurance industry, the competitors can change from year to year and by region.","New reinsurance opportunities continue to be highly price competitive; however, companies that consistently win business are financially strong, provide flexible terms and conditions, have a positive reputation, deliver excellent service, and demonstrate execution certainty and a long-term commitment to the business underwritten.

The Company’s purpose has been especially evident while it protects the financial security of individuals and families affected by COVID-19."
Item 1,Effects of COVID-19 on the Company’s Workforce,"The Company responded to the pandemic with decisive and swift action. Over 95% of its global employees quickly became remote workers, and remote working in several geographies will continue to be the norm for at least part of 2021. While where the Company’s employees work has changed, its employees continue to be committed and highly productive.
Throughout 2020, the Company increased its focus on the physical and mental well-being of its employees. The Company created and implemented its Care Strategy to ensure a sense of community and enhance collaboration among its global teams while working remotely and social distancing. The Company’s Care Strategy addressed many diverse topics affecting the Company’s employees including health and wellness (professionally and personally), how to work effectively in a virtual workplace, and how to manage dispersed teams.","Throughout 2020, the Company increased its focus on the physical and mental well-being of its employees.

Item 1,The Company’s Culture,"Work at the Company is undertaken in a culture that is highly collaborative, which encourages innovation and entrepreneurship and demands the highest integrity. The Company’s culture of combining technical expertise with curiosity and creativity in partnership with its clients defines the way the Company works internally and externally.
From the beginning, the Company was built on trust. Nearly 50 years later, trusted relationships – starting with the Company’s employees and extending to its clients, partners, and investors – remain the foundation of its success. In 2019, the company-wide engagement survey demonstrated employees’ trust in what the Company does. Trust throughout the global workforce at the Company rated higher than 90% of the hundreds of other companies participating in the survey, which was conducted by a globally recognized workforce consulting firm. The Company honors its commitments to its employees, who in turn enable the Company to fulfill its commitments to its clients, shareholders, and society.
Overall, the Company’s employee engagement ranked in the top quartile globally, according to the 2019 survey. The Company’s engagement score is equal when seen along global gender lines. The engagement score for U.S. employees in under-represented groups is within one percentage point of the Company’s overall average. Results from the global engagement survey, together with high employee retention rates, highlight the commitment of the Company’s board of directors and executive leadership team to the Company’s employees and the employees’ commitment to the Company.","The Company’s culture of combining technical expertise with curiosity and creativity in partnership with its clients defines the way the Company works internally and externally.

Item 1,"Talent Attraction, Retention and Development","The Company must continue to attract, develop and retain exceptional talent in order to continue producing innovative solutions for its clients. The Company seeks talent capable of combining logic with curiosity and who will live its values every day. The Company’s focus on employee retention has resulted in a three-year average annual voluntary attrition rate of 6.7% globally. The Company’s new-hire one-year total attrition rate is only 3%.
The Company invests significant resources to ensure its employees continually learn and grow throughout all stages of their careers with the Company. Technical expertise is critical to the Company’s organization and a focus on professional development is one of the pillars within its development philosophy. The Company couples this with development of effective interpersonal and leadership skills. The Company has crafted a suite of programs and workshops for individual contributors as well as for those in management and leadership roles. The Company also invests in international assignments, aimed at both developing the individual and enhancing the contribution to its businesses.","The Company’s focus on employee retention has resulted in a three-year average annual voluntary attrition rate of 6.7% globally.

Item 1,Compensation and Benefits and Pay Equity,"The Company is committed to fostering a culture that is inclusive, collaborative, and socially responsible. The Company is strengthened by its diverse workforce and recognizes that its employees are its greatest asset.
The Company’s compensation programs, comprised of salary together with short and long-term incentives, strike a balance between external market competitiveness and internal equity, balancing global consistency with local market variations. This balance is achieved through consistent application of program standards on a global basis, while targeting compensation at competitive levels in the markets where it competes for talent.
The Company’s benefit programs are designed to support and enhance its employees’ total reward package. Benefits are aligned with local market practices and include healthcare, retirement and savings, education assistance, flexible work programs, employee assistance programs, wellness programs, and parental leave programs, amongst others.
The Company has long been committed to ensuring equal pay for equal work. A Company-wide pay equity study, conducted by a third-party consultant, considered the average pay of females to males in comparable roles. The study analyzed the pay practices of all U.S. and non-U.S. employees in countries with more than 50 employees (representing 83% of the Company’s employees worldwide). The results concluded that women at the Company are paid 100.1% of what men are paid for comparable jobs. In addition, in the U.S., when using the same methodology of comparable roles, the average non-Caucasian to Caucasian pay ratio was 100.9%.
The Company is committed to 100% gender and racial pay equity, and will continue to review pay equity annually, and take action as required, to ensure its compensation program remains aligned with its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Ensuring the Company’s compensation practices are equitable is imperative to maintain the Company’s culture and to ensure fair treatment of its employees.

Item 1,"Corporate Social Responsibility, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion","The Company believes that creating long-term value for its stakeholders implicitly requires enacting and executing sustainable business practices and strategies that, while delivering competitive returns, also take into account environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") issues. The Company strives to govern in a sustainable manner that recognizes the need for strong governance, effective management systems and robust controls alongside its long-term operational goals and strategies. The Company understands that it has a responsibility to monitor and control its ecological and societal impact and adopt responsible practices on ESG issues in addition to its obligations regarding corporate strategy, risks, opportunities, and performance.
The Company strives to cultivate an environment in which diverse experiences and perspectives are welcomed and employees feel comfortable and encouraged to discuss diversity, equity and inclusion topics. The Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are focused in four areas: (i) developing leadership capabilities to better enable an inclusive workplace; (ii) retaining and engaging its workforce; (iii) increasing diversity in the talent pipeline; and (iv) further embedding diversity, equity and inclusion in its culture. 97% of the Company’s global employees have undertaken Everyday (Unconscious) Bias training. The Company’s education and accountability initiatives are the foundation of its efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.
The Company’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Councils proactively leverage diverse teams around the world and serve as thought leaders for the Company to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Item 1,Corporate and Other,"Corporate and Other revenues primarily include investment income from unallocated invested assets, investment related gains and losses and service fees. Corporate and Other expenses consist of the offset to capital charges allocated to the operating segments within the policy acquisition costs and other insurance income line item, unallocated overhead and executive costs, interest expense related to debt, and the investment income and expense associated with the Company’s collateral finance and securitization transactions and service business expenses. Additionally, Corporate and Other includes results from certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, such as RGAx, and joint ventures that, among other activities, develop and market technology, and provide consulting and outsourcing solutions for the insurance and reinsurance industries. The Company has increased its investment and expenditures in this area in an effort to both support its clients and accelerate the development of new solutions and services to increase customer engagement within the life insurance industry and hence generate new future revenue streams.","Corporate and Other revenues primarily include investment income from unallocated invested assets, investment related gains and losses and service fees.

Item 7,Overview,"The Company is among the leading global providers of life reinsurance and financial solutions, with $3.5 trillion of life reinsurance in force and assets of $84.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. Traditional reinsurance includes individual and group life and health, disability, and critical illness reinsurance. Financial solutions includes longevity reinsurance, asset-intensive reinsurance, capital solutions, including financial reinsurance and stable value products. The Company derives revenues primarily from renewal premiums from existing reinsurance treaties, new business premiums from existing or new reinsurance treaties, fee income from financial solutions business and income earned on invested assets.
The Company’s underwriting expertise and industry knowledge has allowed it to expand into international markets and now has operations in over 25 countries including locations in Canada, the Asia Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The Company generally starts operations from the ground up in new markets as opposed to acquiring existing operations, and it often enters new markets to support its clients as they expand internationally. Based on the compilation of information from competitors’ annual reports, the Company believes it is the second-largest global life and health reinsurer in the world based on 2019 life and health reinsurance revenues. The Company conducts business with the majority of the largest U.S. and international life insurance companies. The Company has also developed its capacity and expertise in the reinsurance of longevity risks, asset-intensive products (primarily annuities and corporate-owned life insurance) and financial reinsurance. More recently, the Company has increased its investment and expenditures in client service and technology-oriented initiatives to both support its clients and generate new future revenue streams.
Historically, the Company’s primary business has been traditional life reinsurance, which involves reinsuring life insurance policies that are often in force for the remaining lifetime of the underlying individuals insured, with premiums earned typically over a period of 10 to 30 years or longer. Each year, however, a portion of the business under existing treaties terminates due to, among other things, lapses or voluntary surrenders of underlying policies, deaths of the insured, and the exercise of recapture options by ceding companies. The Company has expanded its financial solutions business, including significant asset-intensive and longevity risk transactions, which allow its clients to take advantage of growth opportunities and manage their capital, longevity and investment risk.
The Company’s long-term profitability largely depends on the volume and amount of death- and health-related claims incurred and the ability to adequately price the risks it assumes. While death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years, claims become less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to significant fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year. For longevity business, the Company’s profitability depends on the lifespan of the underlying contract holders and the investment performance for certain contracts. Additionally, the Company generates profits on investment spreads associated with the reinsurance of investment type contracts and generates fees from financial reinsurance transactions, which are typically shorter duration than its traditional life reinsurance business. The Company believes its sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover potential claims payments on both a short-term and long-term basis.

Item 7,Premiums Receivable,"Premiums are accrued when due and in accordance with information received from the ceding company. When the Company enters into a new reinsurance agreement, it records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty. Similarly, when a ceding company fails to report information on a timely basis, the Company records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty as well as historical experience. Other management estimates include adjustments for increased insurance in force on existing treaties, lapsed premiums given historical experience, the financial health of specific ceding companies, collateral value and the legal right of offset on related amounts (i.e. allowances and claims) owed to the ceding company. Under the legal right of offset provisions in its reinsurance treaties, the Company can withhold payments for allowances and claims from unpaid premiums.
","When the Company enters into a new reinsurance agreement, it records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty. Similarly, when a ceding company fails to report information on a timely basis, the Company records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty as well as historical experience."
Item 7,Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits and Incurred but not Reported Claims,"Liabilities for future policy benefits under long-duration life insurance policies (policy reserves) are computed based upon expected investment yields, mortality and withdrawal (lapse) rates, and other assumptions, including a provision for adverse deviation from expected claim levels. Liabilities for policy claims and benefits for short-duration contracts are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period’s claims, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. Short-duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events. The Company primarily relies on its own valuation and administration systems to establish policy reserves. The policy reserves the Company establishes may differ from those established by the ceding companies due to the use of different mortality and other assumptions. However, the Company relies upon its ceding company clients to provide accurate data, including policy-level information, premiums and claims, which is the primary information used to establish reserves. The Company’s administration departments work directly with clients to help ensure information is submitted in accordance with the reinsurance contracts. Additionally, the Company performs periodic audits of the information provided by clients. The Company establishes reserves for processing backlogs with a goal of clearing all backlogs within a ninety-day period. The backlogs are usually due to data errors the Company discovers or computer file compatibility issues, since much of the data reported to the Company is in electronic format and is uploaded to its computer systems.
The Company periodically reviews actual historical experience and relative anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish aggregate policy reserves. Further, the Company establishes premium deficiency reserves if actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing aggregate policy reserves, together with the present value of future gross premiums, are not sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits, settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs. The premium deficiency reserve is established through a charge to income, as well as a reduction to unamortized acquisition costs and, to the extent there are no unamortized acquisition costs, an increase to future policy benefits. Because of the many assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves and the long-term nature of the Company’s reinsurance contracts, the reserving process, while based on actuarial science, is inherently uncertain. If the Company’s assumptions, particularly on mortality, are inaccurate, its reserves may be inadequate to pay claims and there could be a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Claims payable for incurred but not reported losses for long-duration life policies are determined using case-basis estimates and lag studies of past experience. The time lag from the date of the claim or death to the date when the ceding company reports the claim to the Company can be several months and can vary significantly by ceding company, business segment and product type. Incurred but not reported claims are estimates on an undiscounted basis, using actuarial estimates of historical claims expense, adjusted for current trends and conditions. These estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the amount recognized, which are reflected in net income in the period in which they are determined.
Claims payable for incurred but not reported losses for disability, medical and other short-duration contracts are determined using actuarial methods based on historical claim patterns as well as estimated changes in cost trends. The Company also reviews and evaluates how prior periods’ estimates are developed when estimating the accrual for the current period. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to the current period expense. Historically, the amount of the claim development adjustment made in subsequent reporting periods for prior period estimates has been in a reasonable range given the Company’s normal claim fluctuations.

Item 7,"Valuation of Investments, Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments","The Company primarily invests in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, short-term investments, and other invested assets. For investments reported at fair value, the Company utilizes, when available, fair values based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are very liquid investments and the valuation does not require management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market valuation techniques, market comparable pricing and the income approach. The Company may utilize information from third parties, such as pricing services and brokers, to assist in determining the fair value for certain investments; however, management is ultimately responsible for all fair values presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. This includes responsibility for monitoring the fair value process, ensuring objective and reliable valuation practices and pricing of assets and liabilities, and approving changes to valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The selection of the valuation technique(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and the nature of the investment being valued and significant expertise and judgment is required.
Fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, less applicable deferred income taxes as well as related adjustments to deferred acquisition costs, if applicable, are reflected as a direct charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets.
See “Investments” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” and Note 6 – “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation of the Company’s investments.
Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of any unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. For a discussion regarding the valuation allowance for mortgage loans see “Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition, investments are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value necessitates the recording of an allowance for credit losses or an impairment for non-credit factors. Impairment losses for non-credit factors are recognized in AOCI whereas allowances for credit losses are recognized in investment related gains (losses), net. See “Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the policies regarding allowance for credit losses and impairments.","The Company primarily invests in fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, short-term investments, and other invested assets.

Item 7,Valuation of Embedded Derivatives,"The Company reinsures certain annuity products that contain terms that are deemed to be embedded derivatives, primarily equity-indexed annuities and variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits. The Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to determine whether it is required to be bifurcated under the general accounting principles for Derivatives and Hedging. If the instrument would not be reported in its entirety at fair value and it is determined that the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and that a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative. Such embedded derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with the host contract.
Additionally, reinsurance treaties written on a modified coinsurance or funds withheld basis are subject to the general accounting principles for Derivatives and Hedging related to embedded derivatives. The majority of the Company’s funds withheld at interest balances are associated with its reinsurance of annuity contracts, the majority of which are subject to the general accounting principles for Derivatives and Hedging related to embedded derivatives. Management believes the embedded derivative feature in each of these reinsurance treaties is similar to a total return swap on the assets held by the ceding companies.
The valuation of the various embedded derivatives requires complex calculations based on actuarial and capital markets inputs and assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows and interpretations of the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice. The valuation of embedded derivatives is sensitive to the investment credit spread environment. Changes in investment credit spreads are also affected by the application of a credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”). The fair value calculation of an embedded derivative in an asset position utilizes a CVA based on the ceding company’s credit risk. Conversely, the fair value calculation of an embedded derivative in a liability position utilizes a CVA based on the Company’s credit risk. Generally, an increase in investment credit spreads, ignoring changes in the CVA, will have a negative impact on the fair value of the embedded derivative (decrease in income). See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” and Note 6 – “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the valuation of the Company’s embedded derivatives.

Item 7,Overview," The Company believes that cash flows from the source of funds available to it will provide sufficient cash flows for the next twelve months to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of the Company under various scenarios that include the potential risk of early recapture of reinsurance treaties, market events and higher than expected claims. The Company is currently holding higher cash and cash equivalents levels in response to COVID-19. The Company performs periodic liquidity stress testing to ensure its asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster its liquidity position under stress scenarios. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed. The Company’s liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be funded through net cash flows from operations. However, in the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond normal liquidity needs, the Company has multiple liquidity alternatives available based on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These alternatives include the sale of invested assets subject to market conditions, borrowings under committed credit facilities, secured borrowings, and if necessary issuing long-term debt, preferred securities or common equity.","The Company believes that cash flows from the source of funds available to it will provide sufficient cash flows for the next twelve months to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of the Company under various scenarios that include the potential risk of early recapture of reinsurance treaties, market events and higher than expected claims.

Item 7,Current Market Environment,"The Company’s average investment yield, excluding spread related business, for 2020 was at 4.00%, 56 basis points below the comparable 2019 rate. However, the current interest rate environment continues to put downward pressure on the Company’s investment yield. The Company’s insurance liabilities, in particular its annuity products, are sensitive to changing market factors. Due to decreases in risk free interest rates, gross unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale increased from $4.5 billion at December 31, 2019 to $7.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Gross unrealized losses increased from $110 million at December 31, 2019 to $197 million at December 31, 2020.
    The Company continues to be in a position to hold any investment security showing an unrealized loss until recovery, provided it remains comfortable with the credit of the issuer. As indicated above, gross unrealized gains on investment securities of $7.4 billion remain well in excess of gross unrealized losses of $197 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company does not rely on short-term funding or commercial paper and to date it has experienced no liquidity pressure, nor does it anticipate such pressure in the foreseeable future.
The Company projects its reserves to be sufficient and it would not expect to write down deferred acquisition costs or be required to take any actions to augment capital, even if interest rates remain at current levels for the next five years, assuming all other factors remain constant. While the Company has felt the pressures of sustained low interest rates and volatile equity markets and may continue to do so, its business and results of operations are not overly sensitive to these risks. Mortality and morbidity risks continue to be the most significant risk for the Company. Although management believes the Company’s current capital base is adequate to support its business at current operating levels, it continues to monitor new business opportunities and any associated new capital needs that could arise from the changing financial landscape.","The Company’s average investment yield, excluding spread related business, for 2020 was at 4.00%, 56 basis points below the comparable 2019 rate.

Item 7,Statutory Dividend Limitations,"RCM, RGA Reinsurance and Chesterfield Re are subject to Missouri statutory provisions that restrict the payment of dividends. They may not pay dividends in any 12-month period in excess of the greater of the prior year’s statutory net gain from operations or 10% of statutory capital and surplus at the preceding year-end, without regulatory approval. Aurora National is subject to California statutory provisions that are identical to those imposed by Missouri regarding the ability of Aurora National to pay dividends to RGA Reinsurance. The applicable statutory provisions only permit an insurer to pay a shareholder dividend from unassigned surplus. Any dividends paid by RGA Reinsurance would be paid to RCM, its parent company, which in turn has restrictions related to its ability to pay dividends to RGA. Chesterfield Re would pay dividends to its immediate parent Chesterfield Financial, which would in turn pay dividends to RCM, subject to the terms of the indenture for the embedded value securitization transaction, in which Chesterfield Financial cannot declare or pay any dividends so long as any private placement notes are outstanding. The MDCI allows RCM to pay a dividend to RGA to the extent RCM received the dividend from its subsidiaries, without limitation related to the level of unassigned surplus. Dividend payments from other subsidiaries are subject to regulations in the jurisdiction of domicile, which are generally based on their earnings and/or capital level.
The dividend limitations for RCM, RGA Reinsurance and Chesterfield Re are based on statutory financial results. Statutory accounting practices differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Significant differences include the treatment of deferred acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, required investment reserves, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes.
    Dividend payments from non-U.S. operations are subject to similar restrictions established by local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent to a portion of the prior year’s statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of the Company’s non-U.S. operations may also limit or prohibit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of the non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries that are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow to RGA.","RCM, RGA Reinsurance and Chesterfield Re are subject to Missouri statutory provisions that restrict the payment of dividends.

Item 7,Debt,"Certain of the Company’s debt agreements contain financial covenant restrictions related to, among others, liens, the issuance and disposition of stock of restricted subsidiaries, minimum requirements of consolidated net worth, maximum ratios of debt to capitalization and change of control provisions. The Company is required to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, as defined in the debt agreements, of $5.3 billion, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. Also, consolidated indebtedness, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, cannot exceed 35% of the sum of the Company’s consolidated indebtedness plus adjusted consolidated stockholders’ equity. A material ongoing covenant default could require immediate payment of the amount due, including principal, under the various agreements. Additionally, the Company’s debt agreements contain cross-acceleration covenants, which would make outstanding borrowings immediately payable in the event of non-payment of certain other indebtedness when demanded, and any other event which results in the acceleration of the maturity of such other indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under its debt agreements and was in compliance with all covenants under those agreements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average interest rate on long-term debt outstanding was 4.54% and 4.82%, respectively. The ability of the Company to make debt principal and interest payments depends on the earnings and surplus of its subsidiaries, investment earnings on undeployed capital proceeds, available liquidity at the holding company, and the Company’s ability to raise additional funds.
On June 9, 2020, RGA issued 3.15% Senior Notes due June 15, 2030, with a face amount of $600 million. This security has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The net proceeds were approximately $593 million and will be used in part to repay the Company’s $400 million 5.00% Senior Notes due in 2021, and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes. Capitalized issue costs were approximately $5 million.
On May 15, 2019, RGA issued 3.9% Senior Notes due May 15, 2029 with a face amount of $600 million. This security has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The net proceeds were approximately $594 million and were used in part to repay upon maturity the Company’s $400 million 6.45% Senior Notes that matured in November 2019. The remainder will be used for general corporate purposes. Capitalized issue costs were approximately $5 million.
The Company enters into derivative agreements with counterparties that reference either the Company’s debt rating or its financial strength rating. If either rating is downgraded in the future, it could trigger certain terms in the Company’s derivative agreements, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of the Company’s derivative agreements, there is a termination event, should the long-term senior debt ratings drop below either BBB+ (S&P) or Baa1 (Moody’s) or the financial strength ratings drop below either A- (S&P) or A3 (Moody’s).
The Company may borrow up to $850 million in cash and obtain letters of credit in multiple currencies on its syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in August 2023. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no cash borrowings outstanding and $21 million in issued, but undrawn, letters of credit under this facility.
    Based on the historic cash flows and the current financial results of the Company, management believes RGA’s cash flows will be sufficient to enable RGA to meet its obligations for at least the next 12 months.","Also, consolidated indebtedness, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, cannot exceed 35% of the sum of the Company’s consolidated indebtedness plus adjusted consolidated stockholders’ equity. A material ongoing covenant default could require immediate payment of the amount due, including principal, under the various agreements. Capitalized issue costs were approximately $5 million. This security has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 7,Letters of Credit,"The Company has obtained bank letters of credit in favor of various affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies from which the Company assumes business. These letters of credit represent guarantees of performance under the reinsurance agreements and allow ceding companies to take statutory reserve credits. Certain of these letters of credit contain financial covenant restrictions similar to those described in the “Debt” discussion above. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately $23 million of outstanding bank letters of credit in favor of third parties. Additionally, in accordance with applicable regulations, the Company utilizes letters of credit to secure statutory reserve credits when it retrocedes business to its affiliated subsidiaries. The Company cedes business to its affiliates to help reduce the amount of regulatory capital required in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the UK. The Company believes the capital required to support the business in the affiliates reflects more realistic expectations than the original jurisdiction of the business, where capital requirements are often considered to be quite conservative. As of December 31, 2020, $1.5 billion in letters of credit from various banks were outstanding, but undrawn, backing reinsurance between the various subsidiaries of the Company. See Note 13 – “Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s letter of credit facilities.","These letters of credit represent guarantees of performance under the reinsurance agreements and allow ceding companies to take statutory reserve credits.

The Company cedes business to its affiliates to help reduce the amount of regulatory capital required in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the UK."
Item 7,Collateral Finance and Securitization Notes and Statutory Reserve Funding,"The Company uses various internal and third-party reinsurance arrangements and funding sources to manage statutory reserve strain, including reserves associated with the U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX) and principles-based reserves (commonly referred to PBR), and the associated collateral requirements. Assets in trust and letters of credit are often used as collateral in these arrangements.
Regulation XXX, implemented in the U.S. for various types of life insurance business beginning January 1, 2000, significantly increased the level of reserves that U.S. life insurance and life reinsurance companies must hold on their statutory financial statements for various types of life insurance business, primarily certain level premium term life products. The reserve levels required under Regulation XXX increase over time and are normally in excess of reserves required under GAAP. In situations where primary insurers have reinsured business to reinsurers that are unlicensed and unaccredited in the U.S., the reinsurer must provide collateral equal to its reinsurance reserves in order for the ceding company to receive statutory financial statement credit. In order to manage the effect of Regulation XXX on its statutory financial statements, RGA Reinsurance has retroceded a majority of Regulation XXX reserves to unaffiliated and affiliated reinsurers, both licensed and unlicensed.
Effective in 2017, PBR is permitted in the U.S. During 2016, the NAIC amended the standard valuation law to adopt life PBR that was effective January 1, 2017, allowing a three-year adoption period. The Company adopted PBR in 2020. Under PBR, reserves are determined based on terms of the reinsurance agreement which may differ from those of the direct policies.
RGA Reinsurance’s statutory capital may be significantly reduced if the unlicensed unaffiliated or affiliated reinsurer is unable to provide the required collateral to support RGA Reinsurance’s statutory reserve credits and RGA Reinsurance cannot find an alternative source for collateral.
The Company has issued both collateral finance and securitization notes. The consolidated balance sheets include outstanding notes of $388 million and $598 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 14 – “Collateral Finance and Securitization Notes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s collateral finance and securitization notes.
The demand for financing of the ceded reserve credits associated with the Company’s assumed term life business has grown at a slower rate in recent years. The Company has been able to utilize its certified reinsurer, RGA Americas, as a means of reducing the burden of financing PBR, Regulation XXX and other types of reserves. The Company’s PBR and Regulation XXX statutory reserve requirements associated with term life business and other statutory reserve requirements continues to require the Company to obtain additional letters of credit, put additional assets in trust, or utilize other funding mechanisms to support reserve credits. If the Company is unable to support the reserve credits, the regulatory capital levels of several of its subsidiaries may be significantly reduced, while the regulatory capital requirements for these subsidiaries would not change. The reduction in regulatory capital would not directly affect the Company’s consolidated shareholders’ equity under GAAP; however, it could affect the Company’s ability to write new business and retain existing business.
Affiliated captives are commonly used in the insurance industry to help manage statutory reserve and collateral requirements. The NAIC analyzed the insurance industry’s use of affiliated captive reinsurers to satisfy certain reserve requirements and in 2014 adopted measures to promote uniformity in both the approval and supervision of such captives reinsuring business subject to Regulation XXX, allowing current captives to continue in accordance with their currently approved plans. Reinsuring business subject to the additional provisions of Actuarial Guideline 48 increases costs and adds complexity.  In the U.S., the introduction of the certified reinsurer has provided an alternative way to manage collateral requirements. In 2014, RGA Americas was designated as a certified reinsurer by the MDCI. This designation allows the Company to retrocede business to RGA Americas in lieu of using captives for collateral requirements. Therefore, the Company has chosen not to establish captives subject to Actuarial Guideline 48.
It is also possible that the NAIC could place limits on the recognition of the Company’s capital held in related party captives when adopting its group capital calculation. Doing so would adversely impact the amount of capital that the group would otherwise be able to recognize and report as capital resident in the group, potentially requiring the Company to restructure or change the financing of its captives.","The Company uses various internal and third-party reinsurance arrangements and funding sources to manage statutory reserve strain, including reserves associated with the U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX) and principles-based reserves (commonly referred to PBR), and the associated collateral requirements.

Item 7,Assets in Trust,"The Company enters into reinsurance treaties in the ordinary course of business. In some cases, if the credit rating and/or defined statutory measures of the Company declines to certain levels, the reinsurance treaty would require the Company to post collateral or additional collateral to secure the Company’s obligations under such reinsurance treaty, obtain guarantees, permit the ceding company to recapture such reinsurance treaty, or some other negotiated remedy. As of December 31, 2020, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have been required to post additional collateral or have had a reinsurance treaty recaptured as a result of a credit downgrade or a defined statutory measure decline.
    In addition, certain reinsurance treaties require the Company to place assets in trust at the time of closing to collateralize its obligations to the ceding company. Assets placed in trust continue to be owned by the Company, but their beneficial ownership and use are restricted based on the terms of the trust agreement. Securities with an amortized cost of $3.2 billion were held in trust for the benefit of the Company’s subsidiaries to satisfy collateral requirements for reinsurance business at December 31, 2020. Additionally, securities with an amortized cost of $27.7 billion as of December 31, 2020, were held in trust to satisfy collateral requirements under certain third-party reinsurance treaties. Under certain conditions, the Company may be obligated to move reinsurance from one subsidiary to another subsidiary, post additional collateral or make payments under a given reinsurance treaty. These conditions include change in control or ratings of the subsidiary, insolvency, nonperformance under a reinsurance treaty, or loss of license or other regulatory authorization of such subsidiary. If the Company was ever required to move reinsurance from one subsidiary to another subsidiary, the risk to the Company on a consolidated basis under the reinsurance treaties would not change; however, additional collateral may need to be posted or additional capital may be required due to the change in jurisdiction of the subsidiary reinsuring the business, which could lead to a strain on liquidity.
Proceeds from the notes issued by Timberlake Financial and RGA’s direct investment in Timberlake Financial were deposited into a series of trust accounts as collateral and are not available to satisfy the general obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held deposits in trust and in custody of $571 million for this purpose, which is not included in the figures above. A reserve account has been established to cover interest payments on notes issued by Chesterfield Financial that are not available to satisfy the general obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company held deposits in trust of $10 million for this purpose, which is not included in the figures above. See “Collateral Finance and Securitization Notes and Statutory Reserve Funding” above for additional information on the Timberlake Financial and Chesterfield Financial notes.","In some cases, if the credit rating and/or defined statutory measures of the Company declines to certain levels, the reinsurance treaty would require the Company to post collateral or additional collateral to secure the Company’s obligations under such reinsurance treaty, obtain guarantees, permit the ceding company to recapture such reinsurance treaty, or some other negotiated remedy.

Item 7,Reinsurance Operations,"Reinsurance treaties, whether facultative or automatic, generally provide recapture provisions. Most U.S.-based reinsurance treaties include a recapture right for ceding companies, generally after 10 years. Outside of the U.S., treaties primarily include a mutually agreed-upon recapture provision. Recapture rights permit the ceding company to reassume all or a portion of the risk formerly ceded to the reinsurer. In some situations, the Company has the right to place assets in trust for the benefit of the ceding company in lieu of recapture. Additionally, certain treaties may grant recapture rights to ceding companies in the event of a significant decrease in RGA Reinsurance’s NAIC risk based capital ratio or financial strength rating. The RBC ratio trigger varies by treaty, with the majority between 125% and 225% of the NAIC’s company action level. Financial strength rating triggers vary by reinsurance treaty with the majority of the triggers reached if the Company’s financial strength rating falls five notches from its current rating of “AA-” to the “BBB” level on the S&P scale. Recapture of business previously ceded does not affect premiums ceded prior to the recapture of such business, but would reduce premiums in subsequent periods. Upon recapture, the Company would reflect a net gain or loss on the settlement of the assets and liabilities associated with the reinsurance treaty. In some cases, the ceding company is required to pay the Company a recapture fee.","Most U.S.-based reinsurance treaties include a recapture right for ceding companies, generally after 10 years.

Item 7,Guarantees,"The Company has issued guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries for the payment of amounts due under certain reinsurance treaties, securities borrowing arrangements, financing arrangements and office lease obligations, whereby if a subsidiary fails to meet an obligation, the Company or one of its other subsidiaries will make a payment to fulfill the obligation. In limited circumstances, treaty guarantees are granted to ceding companies in order to provide additional security, particularly in cases where the Company’s subsidiary is relatively new, unrated, or not of significant size, relative to the ceding company. Potential guaranteed amounts of future payments will vary depending on production levels and underwriting results. Guarantees related to borrowed securities provide additional security to third parties should a subsidiary fail to return the borrowed securities when due. The Company has issued payment guarantees on behalf of two of its subsidiaries in the event the subsidiaries fail to make payment under their office lease obligations. See Note 12 – “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a table that presents the amounts for guarantees, by type, issued by the Company.
In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers pursuant to its charters and by-laws. Since this indemnity generally is not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under this indemnity in the future.","The Company has issued guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries for the payment of amounts due under certain reinsurance treaties, securities borrowing arrangements, financing arrangements and office lease obligations, whereby if a subsidiary fails to meet an obligation, the Company or one of its other subsidiaries will make a payment to fulfill the obligation. Potential guaranteed amounts of future payments will vary depending on production levels and underwriting results. In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers pursuant to its charters and by-laws."
Item 8,Basis of Presentation,"The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs, premiums receivable, future policy benefits, incurred but not reported claims, income taxes, valuation of investments and investment impairments, and valuation of embedded derivatives. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used by management.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RGA and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, and any variable interest entities where the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates variable interest entities in accordance with the general accounting principles for Consolidation. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but are not required to be consolidated are reported under the equity method of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
There were no subsequent events that would require disclosure or adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.",Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used by management. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but are not required to be consolidated are reported under the equity method of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. There were no subsequent events that would require disclosure or adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.
Item 8,Fixed Maturity Securities,"The Company identifies fixed maturity securities that could result in a credit loss by monitoring market events that could impact issuers’ credit ratings, business climates, management changes, litigation, government actions and other similar factors. The Company also monitors late payments, pricing levels, rating agency actions, key financial ratios, financial statements, revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues.
The Company reviews all securities on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a decline in value exists and whether an allowance for credit losses or impairment for non-credit losses should be recognized. The Company considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a security is impaired due to credit or non-credit components. Relevant facts and circumstances considered include: (1) the reasons for the decline in fair value; (2) the issuer’s financial position and access to capital; and (3) the Company’s intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost that, in some cases, may extend to maturity.
Beginning on January 1, 2020, with the Company’s adoption of Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, credit losses are recognized through an allowance account. Prior to January 1, 2020, credit losses were recognized as a reduction to the amortized cost. Credit impairments and changes in the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities are reflected in investment related gains (losses), net on the consolidated statements of income. Non-credit impairment losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). See “New Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the effect of the adoption of the standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Impairment losses on fixed maturity securities recognized in the financial statements are dependent on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security. If the Company intends to sell a security or it is more likely than not that it would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, less any recorded credit loss, it recognizes an impairment loss in investment related gains (losses), net for the difference between amortized cost and fair value.
The Company estimates the amount of the credit loss component of a fixed maturity security impairment as the difference between amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The Company excludes accrued interest from the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an asset-backed or floating rate security. The techniques and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security. The asset-backed securities’ cash flow estimates are based on security-specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support, including subordination and guarantees.
The Company writes off uncollectible fixed maturity securities when (1) it has sufficient information to determine that the issuer of the security is insolvent or (2) it has received notice that the issuer of the security has filed for bankruptcy, and the collectability of the asset is expected to be adversely impacted by the bankruptcy.
In periods after an impairment loss is recognized for non-credit loss components on a fixed maturity security, the Company will report the impaired security as if it had been purchased on the date it was impaired and will continue to estimate the present value of the estimated cash flows of the security.","The Company identifies fixed maturity securities that could result in a credit loss by monitoring market events that could impact issuers’ credit ratings, business climates, management changes, litigation, government actions and other similar factors.

Item 8,Mortgage Loans on Real Estate,"Beginning on January 1, 2020, with the Company’s adoption of Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, valuation allowances on mortgage loans are computed on an expected loss basis using a model that utilizes probability of default and loss given default methods over the lifetime of the loan. Within the reasonable and supportable forecast period (i.e. typically two years), valuation allowances for mortgage loans are established based on several pool-level loan assumptions, defaults and loss severity, loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics and industry statistics. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. The evaluation also includes the impact of expected changes in future macro-economic conditions. The Company reverts to historical loss information for periods beyond which it believes it is able to develop or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. See “New Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 – “Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the effect of the adoption of the standard on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Prior to January 1, 2020, valuation allowances on mortgage loans were computed on an incurred loss basis based upon several loan factors, including the Company’s historical experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics and industry statistics. These evaluations were revised as conditions changed and new information became available. In addition to historical experience, management considered qualitative factors that included the impact of changing macro-economic conditions, which may or may not have been reflected in the loan portfolio performance, and the quality of the loan portfolio.
Any interest accrued or received on the net carrying amount of the impaired loan is included in investment income or applied to the principal of the loan, depending on the assessment of the collectability of the loan. Mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible or that have been foreclosed are charged off against the valuation allowances and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the valuation allowances. Changes in valuation allowances are reported in investment related gains (losses), net on the consolidated statements of income.","Within the reasonable and supportable forecast period (i.e. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.

Item 8,Other Invested Assets,"The Company considers its cost method investments for impairment when the carrying value of these investments exceeds the net asset value. The Company takes into consideration the severity and duration of this excess when deciding if the cost method investment is impaired. For equity method investments (including real estate joint ventures), the Company considers financial and other information provided by the investee, other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments, as well as future capital commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred.","For equity method investments (including real estate joint ventures), the Company considers financial and other information provided by the investee, other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments, as well as future capital commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred."
Item 8,Fair Value Measurements,"General accounting principles for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, establish a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. In compliance with these principles, the Company has categorized its assets and liabilities, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three level hierarchy or separately for assets measured using the net asset value (“NAV”). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), the second highest priority to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.
See Note 6 – “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” for further details on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.","In compliance with these principles, the Company has categorized its assets and liabilities, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three level hierarchy or separately for assets measured using the net asset value (“NAV”). See Note 6 – “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” for further details on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value."
Item 8,Assets and Liabilities by Hierarchy Level,"The Company may utilize information from third parties, such as pricing services and brokers, to assist in determining the fair value for certain assets and liabilities; however, management is ultimately responsible for all fair values presented in the Company’s financial statements. This includes responsibility for monitoring the fair value process, ensuring objective and reliable valuation practices and pricing of assets and liabilities, and approving changes to valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The selection of the valuation technique(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and the nature of the asset or liability being valued and significant expertise and judgment is required.
The Company performs initial and ongoing analysis and review of the various techniques utilized in determining fair value to ensure that they are appropriate and consistently applied, and that the various assumptions are reasonable. The Company analyzes and reviews the information and prices received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value and to monitor controls around pricing, which includes quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by the Company’s investment and accounting personnel. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, review of pricing trends, comparison of a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparison of fair value estimates to management’s knowledge of the current market, and ongoing confirmation that third party pricing services use, wherever possible, market-based parameters for valuation. In addition, the Company utilizes both internal and external cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values utilizing credit spread and other market assumptions, where appropriate. As a result of the analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly. The Company also determines if the inputs used in estimated fair values received from pricing services are observable by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data.
For assets and liabilities reported at fair value, the Company utilizes, when available, fair values based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are very liquid investments and the valuation does not require management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market valuation techniques, market comparable pricing and the income approach. The use of different techniques, assumptions and inputs may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the Company’s securities holdings. For the periods presented, the application of market standard valuation techniques applied to similar assets and liabilities has been consistent.

Item 8,Premiums Receivable,"Premiums are accrued when due and in accordance with information received from the ceding company. When the Company enters into a new reinsurance agreement, it records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty. Similarly, when a ceding company fails to report information on a timely basis, the Company records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty as well as historical experience. Other management estimates include adjustments for increased in force on existing treaties, lapsed premiums given historical experience, the financial health of specific ceding companies, collateral value and the legal right of offset on related amounts (i.e. allowances and claims) owed to the ceding company. Under the legal right of offset provisions in its reinsurance treaties, the Company can withhold payments for allowances and claims from unpaid premiums. Based on its review of these factors and historical experience, the Company did not believe a provision for doubtful accounts was necessary as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.","Similarly, when a ceding company fails to report information on a timely basis, the Company records accruals based on the terms of the reinsurance treaty as well as historical experience.

The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is recognized over the terms of the reinsured policies on a basis consistent with the reporting of those policies.,The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is recognized over the terms of the reinsured policies on a basis consistent with the reporting of those policies.
Item 8,Other Reinsurance Balances,"The Company assumes and retrocedes financial reinsurance contracts that do not expose it to a reasonable possibility of loss from insurance risk. These contracts are reported as deposits and are included in other reinsurance assets/liabilities. The amount of revenue reported in other revenues on these contracts represents fees and the cost of insurance under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Assets and liabilities are reported on a net or gross basis, depending on the specific details within each treaty. Reinsurance agreements reported on a net basis, where a legal right of offset exists, are generally included in other reinsurance balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Balances resulting from the assumption and/or subsequent transfer of benefits and obligations resulting from cash flows related to variable annuities have also been classified as other reinsurance balance assets and/or liabilities. Other reinsurance assets are included in premiums receivable and other reinsurance balances while other reinsurance liabilities are included in other reinsurance balances.","These contracts are reported as deposits and are included in other reinsurance assets/liabilities.

Item 8,"Property, Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer Software","Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as appropriate. The estimated life is generally 40 years for company occupied real estate property, from one to seven years for leasehold improvements, and from three to seven years for all other property and equipment. The cost basis of property, equipment and leasehold improvements was $260 million and $244 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated depreciation of property, equipment and leasehold improvements was $116 million and $99 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Related depreciation expense was $17 million, $18 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage, are capitalized. Amortization of software costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years. Carrying values are reviewed at least annually for indicators of impairment in value. Unamortized computer software costs were $147 million and $151 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Item 8,Operating Joint Ventures,"The Company has made investments in certain joint ventures that are strategic in nature and made other than for the sole purpose of generating investment income. These investments are reported under the equity method of accounting and are included in other assets. The Company’s share of earnings from these joint ventures is reported in other revenues on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s share of earnings from these joint ventures is reported in other revenues on the consolidated statements of income.
Item 8,Future Policy Benefits,"Liabilities for future benefits on life policies are established in an amount adequate to meet the estimated future obligations on policies in force. Liabilities for future policy benefits under long-duration life insurance policies have been computed based upon expected investment yields, mortality and withdrawal (lapse) rates, and other assumptions. These assumptions include a margin for adverse deviation and vary with the characteristics of the plan of insurance, year of issue, age of insured, and other appropriate factors. Interest rates range from 3.0% to 6.0%. The mortality and withdrawal assumptions are based on the Company’s experience as well as industry experience and standards. In establishing reserves for future policy benefits, the Company assigns policy liability assumptions to particular timeframes (eras) in such a manner as to be consistent with the underlying assumptions and economic conditions at the time the risks are assumed. The Company maintains a consistent approach to setting the provision for adverse deviation between eras.
Liabilities for future benefits on longevity business, including annuities in the payout phase, are established in an amount adequate to meet the estimated future obligations on policies in force. Liabilities for future benefits related to the longevity business, including annuities in the payout phase have been calculated using expected mortality, investment yields, and other assumptions. These assumptions include a margin for adverse deviation and vary with the characteristics of the plan of insurance, year of issue, age of insured, and other appropriate factors. The mortality assumptions are based on the Company’s experience as well as industry experience and standards. A deferred profit liability is established when the gross premium exceeds the net premium.
The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish policy benefits. The Company establishes premium deficiency reserves if actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy liabilities together with the present value of future gross premiums will not be sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits, settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs. Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts. The premium deficiency reserve is established by a charge to income, as well as a reduction in unamortized acquisition costs and, to the extent there are no unamortized acquisition costs, an increase in future policy benefits.
The reserving process includes normal periodic reviews of assumptions used and adjustments of reserves to incorporate the refinement of the assumptions. Any such adjustments relate only to policies assumed in recent periods and the adjustments are reflected by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations.
The Company reinsures disability products in various markets. Liabilities for future benefits on disability policies’ active lives are established in an amount adequate to meet the estimated future obligations on policies in force. These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature.
The Company establishes future policy benefits for guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) relating to the reinsurance of certain variable annuity contracts by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess proportionally over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to claims and other policy benefits, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used in estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The Company’s GMDB liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were not material.

Item 8,Other Policy Claims and Benefits,"Claims payable for incurred but not reported losses are determined using case-basis estimates and lag studies of past experience. The time lag from the date of the claim or death to when the ceding company reports the claim to the Company can vary significantly by ceding company, business segment and product type, but generally averages around 3.2 months. Incurred but not reported claims are estimates on an undiscounted basis, using actuarial estimates of historical claims expense, adjusted for current trends and conditions. These estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the amount recognized, which are reflected in claims and other policy benefits in the period in which they are determined.","Claims payable for incurred but not reported losses are determined using case-basis estimates and lag studies of past experience. These estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may vary significantly from the amount recognized, which are reflected in claims and other policy benefits in the period in which they are determined."

Item 8,Foreign Currency Translation,"Assets, liabilities and results of foreign operations are recorded based on the functional currency of each foreign operation. The determination of the functional currency is based on economic facts and circumstances pertaining to each foreign operation. The Company’s material functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Korean won, Euro and South African rand. The translation of the functional currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using weighted-average exchange rates during each year. Gains or losses, net of applicable deferred income taxes, resulting from such translation are included in accumulated currency translation adjustments, in AOCI until the underlying functional currency operation is sold or substantially liquidated.

Item 8,Recognition of Revenues and Related Expenses – Long-Duration Products,"Life and health premiums are recognized as revenue when due from the insured, and are reported net of amounts retroceded. Benefits and expenses are reported net of amounts retroceded and are associated with earned premiums so that profits are recognized over the life of the related contract. This association is accomplished through the provision for future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Other revenue includes items such as treaty recapture fees, fees associated with financial reinsurance and policy changes on interest-sensitive and investment-type products that the Company reinsures. Any fees that are collected in advance of the period benefited are deferred and recognized over the period benefited.
For certain reinsurance transactions involving in force blocks of business, the ceding company pays a premium equal to the initial required reserve (future policy benefit). In such transactions, for income statement presentation, the Company nets the expense associated with the establishment of the reserve against the premiums from the transaction.
Revenues for interest-sensitive and investment-type products consist of investment income, policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration, and surrenders that have been assessed against policy account balances during the period. Interest-sensitive contract liabilities for these products represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expenses include claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances. Interest is credited to policyholder account balances according to terms of the policies or contracts.
For each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with GAAP. The Company must review all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the Company is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a contract does not expose it to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the contract on a deposit method of accounting with any net amount receivable reflected as an asset within premiums receivable and other reinsurance balances, and any net amount payable reflected as a liability within other reinsurance balances. Fees earned on the contracts are reflected as other revenues, rather than premiums.","Benefits and expenses are reported net of amounts retroceded and are associated with earned premiums so that profits are recognized over the life of the related contract.

Item 8,Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,"In 2013, the Company executed a series of incentive agreements with the County of St. Louis, Missouri (the “County”). Under these agreements, the Company transferred ownership in its newly constructed world headquarters to the County in exchange for taxable industrial revenue bonds (the “bonds”), in a series of bond issuances during 2013 and 2014, with a maximum amount of $150 million. As a result, the Company was able to reduce the cost of constructing and operating its world headquarters by reducing certain state and local tax expenditures. The Company simultaneously leased the world headquarters from the County and has an option to purchase the world headquarters for a nominal fee upon tendering the bonds back to the County. The payments due to the Company under the terms of the bonds and the amounts owed by the Company under the terms of the lease agreement qualify for the right of offset under GAAP. As such, neither the bonds nor the lease obligation is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability, respectively. The world headquarters is recorded as an asset of the Company in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.","Under these agreements, the Company transferred ownership in its newly constructed world headquarters to the County in exchange for taxable industrial revenue bonds (the “bonds”), in a series of bond issuances during 2013 and 2014, with a maximum amount of $150 million. The Company simultaneously leased the world headquarters from the County and has an option to purchase the world headquarters for a nominal fee upon tendering the bonds back to the County. As such, neither the bonds nor the lease obligation is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability, respectively."
