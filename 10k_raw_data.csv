Overview,"RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance. We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Australia, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, managed funds and underwriting platforms around the world. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., RREAG, Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and our Lloyd’s syndicate, Syndicate 1458. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures, managed funds and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily through Syndicate 1458 and RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Syndicate 1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses, and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. We also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures, including DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Upsilon RFO and Vermeer. In addition, through Medici, we invest in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk.
Our mission is to match desirable, well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter. We believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term, and to protect communities and enable prosperity. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across market cycles, and keeping our promises. Our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We believe this metric is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance, and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time. The principal drivers of our profit are underwriting income, investment income, and fee income generated by our third-party capital management business.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance, and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we have cultivated strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of several initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded and diversified our casualty and specialty platform and products, and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business.
Our current business strategy focuses predominantly on writing reinsurance, although as we grow our casualty and specialty and other property lines of business, we are increasingly writing excess and surplus lines insurance through delegated authority arrangements. We also pursue a number of other opportunities, such as creating and managing our joint ventures and managed funds, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk, and managing certain strategic investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance. From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures or managed funds, or the acquisition of, or the investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies.
We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty (re)insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and managed funds.
The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate.
A meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes. Our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of these catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers that are affected by these events.
We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover, which primarily impact our Property segment, in both the property catastrophe and other property lines of business. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. Our Casualty and Specialty business, which represents approximately half of our gross premiums written annually, is an efficient use of capital that is generally less correlated with our Property business. It allows us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations. We have created, and manage, multiple capital vehicles across several jurisdictions and may create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capabilities position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.
Our revenues are principally derived from three sources: (1) net premiums earned from the reinsurance and insurance policies we sell; (2) net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains from the investment of our capital funds and the investment of the cash we receive on the policies which we sell; and (3) fees received from our joint ventures and managed funds.
Our expenses primarily consist of: (1) net claims and claim expenses incurred on the policies of reinsurance and insurance we sell; (2) acquisition costs, which typically represent a percentage of the premiums we write; (3) operating expenses, which primarily consist of personnel expenses, rent and other operating expenses; (4) corporate expenses, which include certain executive, legal and consulting expenses, costs for research and development, transaction and integration-related expenses, and other miscellaneous costs, including those associated with operating as a publicly traded company; (5) redeemable noncontrolling interests, which represent the interests of third parties with respect to the net income of DaVinciRe, Medici and Vermeer; and (6) interest and dividends related to our debt and preference shares. We are also subject to taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Since the majority of our income is currently earned in Bermuda, which does not have a corporate income tax, the tax impact to our operations has historically been minimal. In the future, our net tax exposure may increase as our operations expand geographically, or as a result of adverse tax developments.
The underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are discussed frequently by reference to its net claims and claim expense ratio, underwriting expense ratio, and combined ratio. The net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by dividing net claims and claim expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The underwriting expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses (acquisition expenses and operational expenses) by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. We also discuss our net claims and claim expense ratio on a current accident year basis and a prior accident years basis. The current accident year net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking current accident year net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned. The prior accident years net claims and claim expense ratio is calculated by taking prior accident years net claims and claim expenses incurred, divided by net premiums earned."
Effects of Inflation,"General economic inflation has increased and there is a risk of inflation remaining elevated for an extended period, which could cause claims and claim expenses to increase, impact the performance of our investment portfolio or have other adverse effects. This risk may be exacerbated by the steps taken by governments and central banks throughout the world in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The actual effects of the current and potential future increase in inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until, among other items, claims are ultimately settled. The onset, duration and severity of an inflationary period cannot be estimated with precision. We consider the anticipated effects of inflation on us in our catastrophe loss models and on our investment portfolio. Our estimates of the potential effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses. The potential exists, after a catastrophe loss, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy.
"
COVID-19 Pandemic,"Due to the ongoing and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition, including our potential loss exposures. It is not yet possible to give an estimate of all of the Company’s potential reinsurance, insurance or investment exposures, or any other effects that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our results of operations or financial condition. We continue to evaluate industry trends and information received from or reported by clients, brokers, industry actuaries, regulators, courts, and others, and expect historically significant industry losses to emerge over time as the full impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized."

CORPORATE STRATEGY,"Our mission is to match desirable, well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital to achieve our vision of being the best underwriter. We believe that this will allow us to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term, and to protect communities and enable prosperity. Our strategy for achieving these objectives, which is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture, is to operate an integrated system of what we believe are our three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and superior capital management. We believe all three competitive advantages are required to achieve our objectives, and we aim to seamlessly coordinate the delivery of these competitive advantages for the benefit of our shareholders, ceding insurers, brokers, investors in our joint ventures and managed funds, and other stakeholders.
Superior Customer Relationships. We aim to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. We believe our modeling and technical expertise, our risk management products, and our track record of keeping our promises have made us a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We seek to offer stable, predictable and consistent risk-based pricing and a prompt turnaround on claims.
Superior Risk Selection. We aim to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive risk-adjusted return on utilized capital. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as REMS©. We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company.
Superior Capital Management. We aim to write as much attractively priced business as is accessible to us and then manage our capital accordingly. We generally look to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline

and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture and managed fund investors. In using joint ventures and managed funds, we aim to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base, develop fee income, generate profit commissions, diversify our portfolio, and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital providers. We also routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture and managed fund opportunities and strategic investments.
We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team, our integrated and flexible underwriting and operating platform, our significant financial strength, our strong relationships with brokers and customers, our commitment to superior service and our proprietary modeling technology. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture and managed fund partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited."
Managed Joint Ventures and Managed Funds,"We actively manage a number of joint ventures and managed funds which provide us with an additional presence in the market, enhance our client relationships and generate fee income and profit commissions. These joint ventures and managed funds allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base. Currently, our principal joint ventures and managed funds include DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Medici, Upsilon RFO, Upsilon Fund and Vermeer.DaVinci was established in 2001 and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain casualty and specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis. In accordance with DaVinci’s underwriting guidelines, we principally seek to construct for DaVinci a portfolio of short-tail reinsurance risks written primarily alongside Renaissance Reinsurance and certain other operating subsidiaries. From time to time, Renaissance Reinsurance or certain other operating subsidiaries write business for, and then cede it to, DaVinci. Third-party investors subscribe for the majority of the shares of DaVinciRe, DaVinci’s holding company. RUM, a wholly owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe, acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for DaVinciRe in return for a management fee and a performance fee. Our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe was 28.7% at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 21.4%).Top Layer Re was established in 1999 and writes high excess non-U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance. Top Layer Re is owned 50% by State Farm and 50% by Renaissance Reinsurance. State Farm provides $3.9 billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to Top Layer Re. Top Layer Re is managed by RUM in return for a management fee.Medici is an exempted fund that was incorporated in Bermuda in 2009. Medici’s objective is to invest substantially all of its assets in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily correlated to property catastrophe risk. Third-party investors subscribe for the majority of the participating, non-voting common shares of Medici. RFM, a wholly owned subsidiary of RenaissanceRe, acts as the exclusive investment fund manager of Medici in return for a management fee. Our economic ownership in Medici was 14.7% at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 15.7%)."
Strategic Investments,"We also pursue strategic investments where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants. These investments may be directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance, and at times may also be directed at non-insurance risks, such as Insurtech opportunities. We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market. For example, we have a minority shareholding in Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd, a long-term consolidator in the non-life insurance/reinsurance run-off sector, which is accounted for at fair value and is included in other investments. Other examples of strategic investments include our investments in the Tower Hill Companies, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also have investments in Essent Group Ltd. and Trupanion Inc., which are accounted for at fair value and are included in equity investments trading.
The carrying value of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet, individually or in the aggregate, may differ significantly from the realized value we may ultimately attain. For example, we believe that our investments in the Tower Hill Companies, which are recorded under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, would attract a significantly higher valuation than what is currently recognized in our consolidated financial statements. However, under GAAP, we are prohibited from recording these investments at fair value. In addition, there is no liquid market for these investments."
NEW BUSINESS,"From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures and managed funds, or the acquisition of, or investment in, other companies or books of business of other companies. This potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted, additional classes of risk-exposed business, both directly for our own account and through new joint venture opportunities. We also regularly evaluate potential strategic opportunities we believe might utilize our skills, capabilities, proprietary technology and relationships to support possible expansion into further risk-related coverages, services and products. Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage.
We regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business, enhance or focus our strategies, expand our distribution or capabilities, or provide other benefits. In evaluating potential new ventures or investments, we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity, the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage, and opportunities which we believe will not detract from our core operations. We believe that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities and track record of our Capital Partners and Strategic Investments teams.
"
COMPETITION,"The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries, divisions and/or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies, reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies, domestic and international underwriting operations, such as managing general agents, as well as a range of other entities offering risk transfer protection on a collateralized or other non-traditional basis. As our business and the (re)insurance industry continue to evolve, we expect our competitors to evolve as well, and we may face competition from other non-traditional participants, such as technology or Insurtech companies, among others.
We believe that our principal competitors include traditional insurance and reinsurance companies such as Allied World Assurance Company, AG, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Argo Group, Ark Insurance Holdings Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXA XL, Axis Capital Holdings Limited, Chubb Limited, Conduit Holdings Limited, Convex Re Limited, Core Specialty Insurance Holdings, Inc., Everest Re Group, Ltd., Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., James River Insurance Company, LGT Capital Partners Ltd., Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., PartnerRe Ltd., SiriusPoint Reinsurance Ltd., Sompo International, Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (a part of Alleghany Corporation), Validus Reinsurance Ltd. (a part of American International Group Inc.) and Watford Re Ltd. (a part of Arch Capital Group Ltd.).
Our principal competitors also include third-party capital managers such as Aeolus Re Ltd., AlphaCat Managers (a part of American International Group Inc.), Credit Suisse Insurance Linked Strategies, Fermat Capital Management, LLC, Elementum Advisors, LLC, Hudson Structured Capital Management, Leadenhall Capital Partners, LGT Capital Partners Ltd., Nephila Capital Ltd. (a part of Markel Corporation), Pillar Capital Management Limited and Securis Investment Partners LLC.
We also compete with certain Lloyd’s syndicates active in the London market, such as those managed by Beazley PLC, Hiscox Ltd., and Lancashire Holdings, as well as with several other industry participants, such as American International Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the D. E. Shaw Group, Hannover Re AG, Ironshore Inc., Munich Reinsurance Company and Swiss Re Ltd.
Hedge funds, pension funds and endowments, investment banks, insurance exchanges and other capital market participants may also be active in the reinsurance market and the market for related risk, either through the formation of reinsurance companies (such as Aeolus Re Ltd., Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Hamilton Re Ltd., and SiriusPoint Reinsurance Ltd.) or through the use of financial products, such as catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities.
The tax policies of the countries where our customers operate, as well as government sponsored or backed insurance companies and catastrophe funds may also affect demand for reinsurance, sometimes significantly. Moreover, government-backed entities may represent competition for the coverages we provide, either directly or by competing for the business of our customers, thereby reducing the potential amount of third-party private protection our clients may need or desire."
Environmental and Climate Change Matters,"Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe, and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, the severity and frequency of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. While it is difficult to distinguish between permanent climate change and transient climate variability, an ever expanding body of research suggests that these trends are in fact man-made, and, if correct, we believe that this trend will not revert to the mean but continue to worsen. We believe that this increase in severe weather, coupled with currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors that will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. Accordingly, we expect an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of claims, especially from properties located in coastal areas.
The consideration of the impacts of climate change is integral to our ERM process. We have taken measures to mitigate losses related to climate change through our underwriting process and by continuously monitoring and adjusting our risk management models to reflect the higher level of risk that we think will persist. We have been progressively integrating the consideration of the financial risk of climate change into our governance frameworks, risk management processes, and business strategies over the past several years, and many of our regulators are increasingly focused on these and other climate change disclosures.
Our Board of Directors and its committees are actively engaged in the oversight of environmental, social and governance initiatives and receive regular updates from management on progress and developments, and our executive management team and the Board of Directors receive regular reports.
As discussed further below under “—Investments,” we structure our investment portfolio to emphasize the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet our claims obligations, to be well diversified across market sectors and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. To further the sustainability of our investment portfolio, we consider certain environmental, social and governance factors within our investment strategy.
In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, there has been a proliferation of governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to climate change and greenhouse gases, which will also affect our business."
